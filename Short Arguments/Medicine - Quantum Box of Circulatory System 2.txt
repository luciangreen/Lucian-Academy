1. There were no blocks in my blood vessels.  I maintained blood flow with daily exercise.  I exercised.  Blood flowed.  I kept things moving.
2. I relaxed as I recovered.  I maintained normal blood flow to recover from exercise.  I exercised.  My blood flow was faster.  It returned to normal.
3. Meditation also helped me feel more alert in activity.  I maintained normal blood flow when using my circulatory system for normal tasks.  I engaged in cardiovascular activity.  I felt refreshed, alert and energised.  I performed normal tasks.
4. I felt clear.  I knew it was there, and moved it on.  I meditated, giving my voluntary control over involuntary processes.  I detected a piece of food in my blood vessel.  It wasn't there later.
5.  I went for walks.  I detected that I had positive circulatory system function.  Everything kept on moving.  I took breaks from sprints.  I rested.
