Aigs for Pedagogy Helper 3 of 3

35.   I wrote rather than listened. I stated that the creation and performance of the helped pedagogy aig is stronger than seeing and copying it.  The creator/performer examined the aig.  The creator/performer wrote in the aig.  The creator/performer learned about the aig.

36.   The self described what the other thought.  The self breasoned out the 15 breasonings in the aig.  The self wrote about the aig.  The self wrote inside out.  The self described the other.

39.   The self observed that God didn't (did) exist.  Delta time = 0 in aig pedagogy help, showing that God (man) replicates aigs instantly, and so God (man) exists.  The self noticed the ruler.  The self noticed God (the man).  The self noticed the other.

43.   The self observed that aigs helped with pedagogy.  The self was right to know how the other knew what the other knew.  The other knew what the other knew.  The self was right to know this.  So, the self was right to know how the other knew pedagogy.

44.   The self knew that it was good.  The self knew what you knew again.  The self knew what you knew.  The self knew what you knew in detail.  The self knew it.

45.  The self knew about the other also.  The self knew what the other knew and that it was right.  The self knew it.  The other knew it too.  The self knew it was good too.
