Marking Scheme - Humanities and Science 1 of 1



1. The following is the marking scheme for humanities which SHOULD NOT be used (but currently is used, even though it implies agreement and disagreement deserve different marks):

H1 and H2A essays must have breasoned objects and rebreasoned actions completed as part of them.

1a. H1 or 80-100%
An essay is given this mark if the student agrees with the side of the contention agreeing with the writer. An exposition in the first half and critique (agreeing with it) in the second half are required. An exposition is a paraphrasing of the text. A critique is an argument about the text in five paragraphs.
i. 90% essays must have breathsoning and rebreathsoning completed as part of them.
ii. 100% essays must have space and time tests completed as part of them.

2. H2A or 75-79%
An essay is given this mark if the student differs in opinion from the side of the contention agreeing with the writer. An exposition in the first half and critique (differing in opinion from it) in the second half are required.

3. H2B or 70-74%
An essay is given this mark if the student differs in opinion from the side of the contention agreeing with the writer.
An exposition in the first half and critique (differing in opinion from it) in the second half are required. The objects must be breasoned.

4. H3 or 65-69%
An essay is given this mark if the student agrees with the writer in an organised way.
An exposition in five paragraphs is required. The objects must be breasoned.

5. P or 50-64%
An essay is given this mark if the student agrees with the writer.
An exposition in a number of paragraphs other than five is required.

6. N or 0-49%
An essay is given this mark if the student differs in opinion from the writer in the first half or answers another question.
A critique in any number of paragraphs is required.

To earn A (80%), one should write 85 reasons using the breasoning rules (5 exposition + 5 critique + 25 detailed reasoning + 50 mind map), to earn A+, one should write 130 reasons (for each of 10 reasons per essay, 9 reasons support them, and 2 breasoned breathsonings and 1 breasoned rebreathsoning reasons support the original reason), to earn 100%, one should write 190 reasons ( or each of 10 reasons per essay, 9 reasons support them, 2 breasoned breathsonings and 1 breasoned rebreathsoning reasons support the original reason and 3 space tests and 3 time tests breasonings support the original reason). Rarely, 250 breasonings, which earn 100% are universally recognised as supporting the spiritual imagery of a production. See Tables 1-2 below.

Table 1. Number of breasonings required for A+ using current system.

For each of (5 reasons in exposition + 5 reasons in critique =) 10 reasons per essay:	Breasoning for reason 1 for reason n.	Breasoning for Breathsoning for subject noun in reason n.	Maximum A+ = 90 for 130 breasonings (range from 80.1%-90% is 86-130 breasonings).


Breasoning for reason 2 for reason n.	Breasoning for Breathsoning for object noun in reason n.	'


Breasoning for reason 3 for reason n.	Breasoning for Rebreathsoning for Verb in reason n.	'


Breasoning for reason 4 for reason n.	





Breasoning for reason 5 for reason n.	





Breasoning for reason 6 for reason n.	





Breasoning for reason 7 for reason n.	





Breasoning for reason 8 for reason n.	





Breasoning for reason 9 for reason n.	




Table 2. Number of breasonings required for 100% using current system.

For each of (5 reasons in exposition + 5 reasons in critique =) 10 reasons per essay:	Breasoning for reason 1 for reason n.	Breasoning for Breathsoning for subject noun in reason n.	Maximum 100% = 190 breasonings (range from 90.1%-100% is 131-190 breasonings).

Breasoning for reason 4 for reason n.	Space Test: Breasoning for room in reason n.	'


Breasoning for reason 5 for reason n.	Space Test: Breasoning for part of room in reason n.	'


Breasoning for reason 6 for reason n.	Space Test: Breasoning for direction in room in reason n.	'


Breasoning for reason 7 for reason n.	Time Test: Breasoning for time to prepare for action in reason n.	'


Breasoning for reason 8 for reason n.	Time Test: Breasoning for time to do action in reason n.	'


Breasoning for reason 9 for reason n.	Time Test: Breasoning for time to finish action in reason n.	'




The following marking scheme for humanities SHOULD be used (because it gives agreement and disagreement the same mark):

H1 and H2A essays must have breasoned objects and rebreasoned completed as part of them.

1a. A or 75-100%
An essay is given this mark if the student either agrees with or disagrees with the side of the contention agreeing with the writer, regardless. An exposition in the first half and critique in the second half are required. An exposition is a paraphrasing of the text. A critique is an argument about the text in five paragraphs.
i. A+ (87.5%) essays must have breathsoning and rebreathsoning completed as part of them.
ii. 100% essays must have space and time tests completed as part of them.

2. B or 65-74%
An essay is given this mark if the student agrees or differs in opinion from the side of the contention agreeing with the writer, regardless.
An exposition in the first half and critique (differing in opinion from it) in the second half are required. The objects must be breasoned.

3. C or 50-64%
An essay is given this mark if the student agrees or disagrees with the writer, regardless.
An exposition in a number of paragraphs other than five is required.

4. N or 0-49%
An essay is given this mark if the student doesn't answer the question.
A critique in any number of paragraphs is required.


To earn A (75%), one should write 85 reasons using the breasoning rules (5 exposition + 5 critique + 25 detailed reasoning + 50 mind map), to earn A+, one should write 130 reasons (for each of 10 reasons per essay, 9 reasons support them, and 2 breasoned breathsonings and 1 breasoned rebreathsoning reasons support the original reason), to earn 100%, one should write 190 reasons ( or each of 10 reasons per essay, 9 reasons support them, 2 breasoned breathsonings and 1 breasoned rebreathsoning reasons support the original reason and 3 space tests and 3 time tests breasonings support the original reason). Rarely, 250 breasonings, which earn 100% are universally recognised as supporting the spiritual imagery of a production. See Tables 3-4 below.

Table 3. Number of breasonings required for A+ using suggested equitable system.

For each of (5 reasons in exposition + 5 reasons in critique =) 10 reasons per essay:	Breasoning for reason 1 for reason n.	Breasoning for Breathsoning for subject noun in reason n.	Maximum A+ = 87.5 for 130 breasonings (range from 75.1%-87.5% is 86-130 breasonings).

On my blog, I wrote after conferring with the Melbourne University Vice Chancellor Glyn Davis that agreement and disagreement equitably deserve the same grade. Later, the University may institute this change. Teachers and lecturers may recalculate the equitable grade by modifying the current system's grade (see Table 5.) or counting breasonings written down as part of a computational marking scheme.

Table 5. Conversion table from old marking scheme to new equitable marking scheme

Current marking scheme grade letter	Current marking scheme	Number of breasonings in current marking scheme	New equitable marking scheme grade letter	New equitable marking scheme	Number of breasonings in new equitable marking scheme
A++	90.1-100%	131-190	A++	87.6-100%	131-190
A+	80.1-90%	86-130	A+	75.1-87.5%	86-130
H1 or A	80.00%	85	A	75.00% (ranges from 75-79% or 80-80% in current marking scheme)	85
H2A	75-79%	85	
'	'
H2B	70-74%	70-84	B	65-74% (ranges from 65-69% or 70-74% in current marking scheme)	65-84
H3	65-69%	65-69
