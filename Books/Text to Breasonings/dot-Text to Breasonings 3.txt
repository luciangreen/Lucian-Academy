Text to Breasonings 3

1. In Web Editor and Web Finder, the last file and its folder and those in dialogue boxes used were remembered across windows and devices.
2. The Web Finder intelligently remembered regular tasks, such as running a command on (parts of text in files) in a particular folder and counted the breasonings as time passed.
3. I could immediately find files by name or other properties, with autocomplete and group parts of selections, without moving the original files.
4. Files could be undeleted or reverted.
5. The Web Finder search function available from the menu saved previous searches.
6. The calculator was an inspiration, suggesting transcendental topics for work. 
7. The calculator in the Web Finder menu saved results even if it was closed.
8. I automatically organised my finances based on needs and plans and never touched them, spending all my time writing philosophy and computer science.
9. I converted currency in the Web Editor menu field.
10. I could chat with PFT and edit my code.
11. To scroll and compare texts, I inserted a pane divider in State Saving Interpreter (SSI) windows.
12. Web Editor preformatted shell scripts, Prolog files and documentation.
13. Web Editor automatically saved permissions for shell scripts.
14. I customised the Web Editor colour schemes.
15. Web Editor displayed colouring of text for different types of files.
16. I automatically found and ran queries in testing, realising that PFT could quickly finish most of the code, including subterms with address queries.
17. I closed all the Web Editor documents with one command and displayed a warning before running unsaved code.
18. The permanent thing was clicking on the smartphoneâ€™s home screen icon, which reopened closed windows in their previous state.
19. I activated either Web Editor or Web Finder with a click.
