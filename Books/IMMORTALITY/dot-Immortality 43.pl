Immortality 43

StarOS

1. The immortal found the 100% quickly using StarOS. I created an operating system in Starcard with a moving pointer that different programs could modify or control. This operating system, StarOS, included Starlog, a specification programming system that saved time developing algorithms. StarOS featured a mind-reading star on the screen that allowed smart glasses to do neat things and could appear spiritually or using smart glasses. The star, like a doctor, represents a person.
2. The immortal found the complex solution by thinking about it in detail in the simulation and reporting it instantly. The Thought Large-Language Model (LLM), or a small language model, interfaces with and helps present conscious thoughts, considers the user's emotions, and treats them as a person. The model finds their emotional journey, people close to them and how to treat the situation tactfully. Like the Higher Dimensional Computer, it started the next stage of civilisation by marketing its decisions delicately intertwined with the key people it wanted to interact with. The small language model for programming used a diffusion neuronet with optimised choices, such as finding the speed of thought commands including subterm with address, single commands for solving neuronets, induction, visiting spacetime tonic points for faster travel, pre-suggesting and pushing for breasoned space speech, or constraint satisfaction problems.
