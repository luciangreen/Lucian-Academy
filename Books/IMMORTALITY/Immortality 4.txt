1. I gained repair points from bringing supplies.  I began by listing the collisions from all directions.  In these, the objects were possibly mutually annihilated.  Or one was damaged.  Or, the clash had destroyed both, requiring repair points.
2. I wrote the member1.pl algorithm.  I wrote a member predicate using list processing. Then, I translated the member predicate into C.  I translated the list processing command using string to list.  The unification algorithm represented lists as trees as arrays.
3. I also reversed commands, finding their constraints or inductively finding their input. I wrote the one_d_gravity_block.pl algorithm.  I stacked one-dimensional shapes.  I could work out a word or algorithm from its length.  I programmed using previously written algorithms, looking up their usage in the documentation or a reverse documentation command.
4. I wrote the mathematical relations in the tests and replicated all these combinations.  I was responsible because of checking the procedure to 100%.  I listed the necessary tests.  I tested that the method worked in 100% of them.  I modified the procedure to work if required.
5. I found a way to examine the same thought.  I wrote the critical agreement with the idea.  First, I found a good example in the world. Second, I found evidence for good uses.  For example, the breasoning dictionary's properties were correct (the calculation was accurate) and good (the calculation led to good management).
6. Immortality saved the life.  The First Technique treated the argument map as an answer to a question.  The Computational English calculator found the result of unlikely cross-overs in the text.  I found the implication of the rare meeting to be good.  I noted this was saving a life.
7. The physical model underlying the algorithm, for example, V=U+AT, was found by the formula finder.  I wrote the text.  I discovered its internal and external algorithm (where an external algorithm was how it fit into an argument).  I checked each sentence against previous sentences, mimicking what I wanted to be.  I invented characters to talk about this logic, for example, a path-layer who determined whether a student could think of an algorithm.
8. I used the more straightforward formula throughout the work.  I checked the formulas, algorithms and grammar used were correct.  The algorithm was simple.  Also, it had no errors even though it appeared to work.  I ensured that the algorithm worked, by comparing it with the best algorithms, for example, working grammar.
9. I worked out the answer (the algorithm).  I was healthy.  From this, I developed a way of supporting myself.  I could generate jobs from this.  With investments and support, I could invent the necessary work.
10. I found the new geometrical variables and maintained my hair.  I found the new radius from the multiple of the area.  The area was equal to pi*(radius^2).  For an area2 = n*area1, the new radius was equal to sqrt((n*area1)/pi).  I found the radius for the circle on the field.
11. I studied computer science to write my ideas down.  I did this by solving the food maze.  First, I grew my food.  Also, I avoided unhealthy additives.  As a result, I slept well at night.
12. As computer science added knowledge, I predicted that robots will too.   I did this by working out meditation to help the universe.  For example, the meditation centre became a hub of interest for the meditators.  Everyone was positive.  Students learned advanced skills.
13. Some students required more help than others. First, I wrote the inequality between the numbers.  In this, the user entered the inequality and the numbers.  The algorithm returned whether this inequality was true or false. Then, I helped the student to study at the institution.
14. After normalising the squares, I counted them.  I started by counting the list of squares. Then, I used them by making a physical model for the first technique.  In this, I determined the local squares involved.  I found their relationships.
15. Forall encountered an infinite loop when given an undefined variable.  I found that all of the items in one list were members of another.  I wrote the equals symbol to denote this.  I programmed a forall command on all list items by running the same command.  Forall always passed when given an empty list.
16. I specialised in induction and an interpreter.  The induction command found algorithms using a given set of commands.  I wrote this algorithm in C.  It could use a neural network.  I could also write this neural induction command in C.

17. I quickly arrived at the solution.  I did this by manipulating the algebraic expression.  First, I wrote the expression in terms of u(1-u).  Then, I antidifferentiated it. Finally, I substituted u's expression back in.
18. I substituted the value back into the expression to check it.  I expanded the expression.  To do this, I took x(x+1).  I expanded it to x*x+x*1.  I simplified the expression to x^2+x.
19. Simplification prevented bugs and allowed programming.  I simplified the expression.  I started with 1/x * x/3.  I simplified this by cancelling x in the product.  The new expression was 1/1 * 1/3 = 1/3.
20. I also accounted for negative powers.  I multiplied the expressions.  I multiplied x^2 * x^3.  In this, x^a * x^b = x^(a+b).  So, x^2 * x^3 = x^(2+5) = x^7.
21. I found the frontier and worked.  I calculated the expression.  I simplified the expression to f(a)/f(b).  I calculated these expressions.  I calculated this expression.
22. I recorded the phenomenon and the variables.  I found an expression in terms of x for y=f(x).  This equalled x=f-1(y).  In this, f-1(y) was the inverse of f.  I used a neural network to do this.
23. I thought it was wondrous that the idea I knew worked. Next, I wrote whether the actor matched the role.  I did this by describing the actor's appearance. Third, I wrote the list of characters that fit him. Finally, I cast the actors in the roles.
24. I could see Mars.  I created laws for safety and necessity.  I made cars that stayed on the road.  These flew close to the ground.  Looking out the window was like looking out of a building.
25. I agreed with positivity.  I did this by agreeing with safety.  First, I found a safe place.  Then, I visited it regularly.  In this way, people accepted positivity.
26. I placed the files in the mirror folder.  I periodically performed the activity.  It was backing up the data.  I made an alarm to remind myself to do it.  I automatically did this.
27. I wrote educational software.  Earlier, I noted that the different groups agreed on the issue.  These groups represented the whole.  After this, people monitored the state for any necessary changes.  The system required some modifications.
28. I was not held back by objects, discovering new algorithms.  I found all the solutions.  The people were happy until and after seeing the answers.  I programmed to explore ideas.  I found replicators using neural networks.
29. I ran the algorithm writer in retro-mode, finding only intelligent algorithms.  I simulated writing from the start or end of a file.  I chose writing from the start.  In other cases, I read, manipulated and rewrote the file. Finally, I devised List Prolog in BASIC.
30. The guests could play against each other on their phones.  I did this by hosting the algorithm for guests to play.  In one case, I returned the different variables on true, causing the algorithm to return true.  I bug-checked findall in the interpreter.  I supported nested findall.
31. I found combinations of certain unique items.  I wrote the trope_finder.pl algorithm.  I did this by finding all combinations of certain words. For example, I wrote combinations of writing, experience and thoughts.  I detected repeats and found the unique items.
32. I wrote the algorithm, improving it until reaching the goal.  I did this by speaking enough about it.  I planned this with thought.  I talked to indicate people and memory.  Also, I worked for thoughts.

33. The best items were more philosophically inspiring, critically held algorithms.  I deleted any items with more than one instance. Also, I deleted some other items.  In conclusion, I finished with the best and most unique items.  I found their best uses and interactions.
34. The likelihood of one breasoning depended on the order of texts.  An ironism was the same word with a different meaning and the same intermediate breasonings.  The ironism's breasoning was closer to one meaning, so the other meaning was related to it.  For example, the bow's breasoning was \"down\" for both \"bow down\" and \"bow-tie\", which the person had to fasten down to his shirt.  Ironisms helped visualise the words when speaking.
35. A robot could bring enough crates of apples.  I did this by adding x and 3*x.  First, I converted x to 1*x when considering adding the terms.  Second, I added 1+3.  In this way, the result was 4, i.e. 4*x.
36. Also, I could solve u(1-u)=v in different ways.  I started by expanding the brackets.  First, I took the term 3*(b+d). Then, I expanded this to 3*b+3*d. Finally, I substituted values into this expression.
37. I could write -6 as 3*-2, without brackets.  I expanded the brackets again.  I started with 3*(b+(-2*d)).  I expanded this to 3*b+3*(-2*d).  I could further simplify this expression to 3*b-6*d.
38. I simplified 1*x to x. I expanded (A+B)*(C+D).  I wrote it as A*C+A*D+B*C+B*D.  For example, (3+(-1))*(c+d).  I wrote it as 3*c+3*d+ -1*c+ -1*d, simplifying to 3*c+3*d- 1*c -1*d.
39. I performed binary addition by counting up.  I wrote all combinations of a list of items, up to a certain length of a new list.  I found f([0,1],2).  This equalled [[0,0],[0,1],[1,0],[1,1]].  These were the binary digits for [0,1,2,3].
40. The algorithm found whether or not I needed a similar algorithm.  I transformed the term into a computational, then philosophical meaning.  I found the word.  I found this corresponded to a list.  I found this could have the courage to go up to people, to make suggestions.
41. I made a list simpler.  I did this by finding whether there were any duplicates in a list.  First, I listed them.  Then, I found bugs in them.  I fixed them.
42. I compressed until there was no further compression possible.  I tested whether all the items were the same.  I found the first item.  I tested that each item was the same as this item.  I could compress them.
43. I was independent.  I did this by sorting the two lists and putting them together.  First, I subtracted one number from the other.  Second, I graphed them.  In this way, I found a relationship.
44. I argued for progress.  I did this by examining the pedagogical setting.  First, I stated my aim.  Then, I said the reasons for it. Finally, I determined the logic, inventing rules.
45. I wrote the orienteering algorithm, possibly in 3D.  I generated the points.  I gave the starting point.  I traversed the points.  I drew the map.
46. I observed that a computer had created reality in another dimension.  I did this by finding the number of rays hitting a surface.  First, I counted them.  I observed them.  I observed reality.
47. I found that there had been several simulations in science.  I read the measurement on the test tube.  If it curled upwards, I read the bottom.  If it was high in the middle, I read the top.  I avoided taking half-measurements.
48. I aimed to build skills with encouragement.  I started with having the institution.  This institution had the best vocational and theoretical knowledge.  In the institution, the vocational knowledge explored metacognition of learning skills.  Theoretical knowledge contained algorithms related to compilers and induction.

49. I supplemented the computer work with more content and logic.  I listed the authors used, omitting the characters and unclassified names.  I recorded the authors' works used as sources.  I found that human choices were superior to computer choices.  They converged.
50. I agreed with one side, not the other, sometimes one side more than another.  I decided with the ideas on one side.  I didn't agree if I disagreed with a view on that side.  At least, I checked them.  Many people were different.
51. The idea was correct when checked.  I did this by threading the view through the eye of the needle.  First, I found the initial text.  I had opinions about it.  Then, I grounded the work on this.
52. I deleted duplicates according to the heuristic.  I counted the number of duplicate items, i.e.:  A=[1,1,2,3,3],sort(A,B),findall(D,(member(D,B),findall(D,(member(D,A)),E),length(E,F),F>1),G). So, G = [1, 3].  G contained 1 and 3, which had frequency > 1 in A.  I drew a histogram.
53. I checked the word order and capitalisation.  I split the string on [\".\",\"!\",\"?\"].  Given C=\"a! b. c?\", A=\".!?\", string_codes(A,B), string_codes(C,D), split_string(D,B,B,E).  I returned E = [\"a\", \" b\", \" c\"].  I grammar-checked the sentences.
54. I traced the sub-events like an algorithm.  To do this, I predicted the event following the first event.  First, I wrote down the observations.  Second, I wrote down the first event.  Then, I examined the objects leading to the second event.
55. I kept the different ones separately.  I added the like items.  Given A and B, I calculated their sum, A+B.  I examined this philosophically and amalgamated their containers.  I diversified the rest.
56. Some animals came along.  As part of this, I found a new appended list from two old lists.  In this way, the groups came together for the activities.  I detected the thought.  I wrote the essay with some reasons.
57. I considered the items by themselves and not there.  The items were of the same type.  The articles \"a\" and \"b\" were both strings.  They could be concatenated or reversed.  I examined all orders of them.
58. There were type checks inside a command.  I did this by verifying that an item was a number.  I ascertained that it was used and manipulated as a number.  I used a type checker to avoid and possibly report type errors.  The commands had optional type checks as well.
59. I cleaned the tube.  I did this by choosing the lesser of two values each time until reaching a value.  I did this by designing the circuit and taking measurements every so often.  I eliminated the unused wire.  I reused parts of the circuit.
60. I couldn't create a list with a length less than 0.  I got the nth item of a list.  I performed this by counting down from n as I processed the list.  I could have used the code A=[1,2,3],B is 2-1,length(L,B),append(L,[C|_],A).  This algorithm gave the 2nd item C = 2 as desired.
61. I did the right thing.  I verified that A and B were commutative. In other words, A+B = B+A.  I found the noumenon in theatre studies, holding it for someone.  I found the noumenon in psychoanalysis, liking someone.  In these, both items were positive.
62. I used associativity in algebra.  I found that (A*B)*C and A*(B*C) were associative.  For example, (1*2)*3 = 1*(2*3).  I continued to think clearly.  From this, I concluded that multiplication and brackets in this form behaved associatively.
63. I returned a list of n empty's. Next, I counted the length of the list.  I did this using iteration.  I added this procedure to the Prolog predicates for use in C.  I could also find a list with a certain length, e.g. length(A,3) returned A=[empty, empty, empty].
64. In some cases, I left the working there to generate new data had properties, such as one week ago, not one day ago. I determined whether data had the same property to test for instead.  I found the properties of the first pair.  I detected whether the other pairs shared this property.  I found out the way and about the destination.

65.  I verified that an item was a member of a list.  I did this to check that it was a correct answer.  I did this by writing a list of possible solutions.  First, I wrote the limits.  Then I tested them.
66.  I eliminated unwanted traits.  I wrote the list of items in one list but not in another.  I found the genetic subtraction.  I noted that I could remove the original species from the list.  I was fascinated by natural selection.
67.  I could optionally eliminate the empty list from being a sublist.  I checked a person finished that part of the list of tasks.  The father earned his keep and took responsibility for the children.  I could do this by checking that B is a sublist of A because B-A=[].  This could also be accomplished with the code A=[1,2,3,4],B=[2,3],forall(member(D,B),member(D,A)).
68.  I found the functional element from history.  I found a common item in the list of items from the time.  I repeatedly found whether items in A were members of B.  I wrote the following code to do this: A=[1,2,3,4],B=[2,3,5],findall(C,(member(C,A),member(C,B)),D).  The intersection of A and B, D is [2, 3].
69.  I compressed the disk.  I did this by deleting each copy of the file from the disk.  I processed the list, deleting all instances of the item.  I could count the frequency and address of each item.  Then I could delete specific items.  I saved the essential items.   
70.  If A and B in A->B are true, then A->B is true.  I confirmed the conjunction of events.  If not((true,true)) then it returned false, otherwise true.  I took action based on the conjunction.  If I invested in an asset, it would return interest.
71.  I accounted for disk pro rata.  I owned the value of the sum of the items.  I checked that the sum indicated that the disk had fidelity (it wasn't corrupted).  The sum of the file lengths and the unused space equalled the disk length.  I found the total sum of the numbers.
72.  The person checked the work.  The person produced more significant than the given amount of work.  The person showed confidence.  As a result, their facilitator showed confidence.  They showed confidence in the confidence.
73.  I recorded the performance.  I aimed for maximum performance at the institution.  I did this by sorting the items and taking the top value.  First, I performed well on parts of the assessment.  I topped the institution.
74.  I sorted from the lowest to the highest number.  I saw the result of the sort.  Then, I sorted the items using the maximum predicate.  Finally, I found the graph of the items.  I detected the linear gradient.
75.  I designed the binary watch with a bitmap digital time.  The marker awarded the mark for either answer.  If not((false,false)) then it returned true, otherwise false.  I gave A=1,B=1,(A=1->true;B=1).  In this, the expression is true if A=1 or B=1.
76.  I compared the value with the maximum.  I did this by finding the random xs and ys. First, I found the regular xs and random ys. After this, I found the arbitrary xs and regular ys.  Finally, I found the standard xs and ys.
77.  I wrote a practical algorithm.  I did this by finding yes and no answers about a single point.  These were part of different chapters. However, the topic was the same.  The language was similar.  I developed the writing.
78.  The student learnt to paraphrase and cite.  I checked the essay for plagiarism.  The sentence was almost entirely intact in the sentence.  There were over 80% sentences like this.  The student did not cite them, so they failed.  
79.  I completed complex ideas about the work.  I wrote the word processor in Prolog.  I moved the cursor around and typed.  I justified the text.  I paginated the pages.
80.  I kept a breasoning sheet for untranslatable words.  I wrote the breasoning log.  In it was the list of breasonings I had breasoned out.  I recorded the names of the documents that contained the breasonings.  I could easily replace words and translate documents.
