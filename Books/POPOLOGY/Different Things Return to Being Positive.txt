1. RR on MN on RD. A greater algorithm count indicate more diverse arguments and a lesser algorithm count indicates staying on the topic. The vern is \"change\". They change from positive. What are different things? LG: Any things. The change is positive.
2. RR on MN on PR or RD. It should be more positive than before. Positivity should be increased. Identify positivity. Aim for greater positivity. Make the positive change.
3. RD on MN on RD. The English Language Program can be part of the essay. The value changed to positive where there was more time spent analysing the view where the physical constant the train's speed decreased. There is no train, I like the values. The words in the essay return to relevant or on the topic and programmed in the essay. The students should write relevant words and program them.
4. RD on MN on PR on RD. For me, structure is the connections, argument is the algorithms. exposition is grouped algorithms and critique is those groupings with new algorithms,and the mark increases in positivity. Why are essay connections also relevant and programmed? I am given the topic \"knowing\" and the first sentence \"I see you\". I am given the second sentence \"You see me\". \"I see you\" so \"I know you see me\". Clarity is the optic adhered to.
5. MO on MN on RD. I solve negative differences. We need to define positive. LG: I changed to the positive action. What are these edges around it? Positivity is differently interesting. Differences are positive. Diffrent things don't (do) return to being postive.
6. MO on MN on PR on RD. What if terms fluctuate between positive values? We should therefore start with positive values. Each part of the mathematical sentence should change to positive. 1st to 3rd number. + to -. 2nd to 4th number.
7. AM on MN on RD. B1 is arbitrary, B2 is positive. If A contains B, B1 -> B2. A contains B. B1 is there. B1 -> B2.
8. AM on MN on PR on RD. It should be wise to change the diferent thing to positive. Changing is returning. It should exist. It should be positive. It should be necessary.
9. RR on RR. Why should English language run Prolog language?
