Strings to Grammar Song

1. The musician shared a fascinating insight into crafting a film. They explained that a story is like music, and a film can contain songs that are mind-read from the mood of part of the overall song, or the original song can be the film’s theme song. In this case, they crafted a song deeply rooted in philosophy, serving as the perfect inspiration for a movie. The selection of the song was not random but driven by its unique blend of instruments, melody, harmony, and the story it evoked. The philosophy, they noted, was not just a random inspiration but a quantum one that the algorithm, which mind-read them, interpreted as the basis for music. This intriguing algorithmic philosophy often led to the creation of better songs.
2. The musician grounded secondary songs on commercial “thereness” songs. The film’s cinematography perfectly shot scenes from the songs, interpreted based on their sound or inherent qualities. A trill was interpreted as coloured trail lights from flying cars in the air. Strings to Grammar, construed as a screenplay about synthesising time travel in the simulation, had a deep, important-sounding theme song containing a frenetic, high-pitched instrument. The movie poster was rendered from the waviness of time interpreted as a software box image.
3. The musician stated that the story was high-stakes (meaning it was error-free) and philosophical. I wrote the story based on scenes from the music, appropriate for the music’s mood. It included a what-if scenario exploring an exciting and unusual set of circumstances. It contained an implicitly changing protagonist with aims and history and an opposing complex antagonist with their aims. The protagonist aims for particular goals for specific reasons with high stakes (correctness). The story has three acts, one each for build-up, meeting and resolution. 
4. With their innovative use of algorithmic suggestions or breasonings, the musician infused motivations with excitement. They propelled the plot through internal conflict (the protagonist’s internal struggles) and external conflict (external impediments the protagonist opposes to meet their aim). They opted for visual storytelling, using gestures, visuals, and meaning to convey responses, ensure memorable scenes, and aid in plot development or character revelation. They developed a theme and message for the audience to unpack. This theme was intricately woven throughout the story, influencing characters’ choices and plot events.
5. The musician sensed mind reading could sense whether a conclusion was based on other findings in the text, which helped detect essay structure. I mind-read 1-150 hand breasonings, synthesising them in sets of ten, choosing the initial contention the breasonings were written about (or mind-funnelled one breasoning) to influence lighting, make-up or other film-making decisions. I mind-funnelled a breasoning by collecting and selecting from various choices. I wrote each scene to be exciting or crucial to the story, maintaining an engaging pace and timing, building anticipation and releasing it tactically to keep viewers enthusiastic. I struck a balance between original parts and familiar story elements.
6. With their adept use of the combophil algorithm, the musician interpreted a philosophy on a topic. They replaced key terms with given extended configurations and abridged complex stories, such as preventing a time travel accident causing the end of the universe. They made creative choices using the combophil algorithm, influencing the script’s key points. They created a fine arts temporal montage with an implicit story. The philosopher in each department chose a general theme. Popology was responsible for writing the interpreter, while theology was in charge of writing the inductive engine. 
7. The musician had an extensive database of thoughts ready, which could be accessed using random, funnelled mind reading. I used combophil to influence the setting, character, story and other movie elements. The secret algorithm powered viewers in their droves. The algorithm’s song inspired unique visuals and sound. The algorithm was core in the accreditation agency, which supported at least fifty education academies.
8. The musician aimed to educate students about immortality. I wrote characters’ motivations by mind-funnelling three “why” levels. If they needed inspiration, I included a philosophy at the start, for example, simplifying a more significant algorithm into a production line. I repeated this process for their history, which influenced their aims. For instance, they might dream of changing people’s lives because of a childhood inspiration.
9. The musician wanted to see the faces while the actors were talking. I edited the movie using mind-reading, scoring whether a scene was interesting enough and contributed sufficiently to the storyline. I couldn’t change the strength of the mind-reading, but I could change the intelligence by using a decision tree to select from story possibilities, giving a smoother result without an empty feeling. I could colour grade using mind-reading and an algorithm and count to three between lines in editing.
10. The musician was busy playing jack of all trades, producing the movie. I synthesised the characters’ top-level motivations with those of others. These motivations were spread across time and settings and made into the story. Each character had a secret or updated set of ten algorithms for a recurring character. These algorithms had done up movies explaining the algorithm and films relating to the movie, perhaps about helping with the movie production.
