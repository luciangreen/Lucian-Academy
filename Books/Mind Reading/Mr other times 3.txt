21. I mind read past times to examine history.
22. I mind read future times for security reasons.
23. I mind read the animal students in higher education from other times to collect (write areas of study) or plan (write assignments).
24. I individually considered the requisite other times mind read before calculating their synthesis.  I executed the text to breasoning algorithm on a medical text with parts collected with mind reading from past times to harmlessly include them to tend to the feelings of those in the present.
25. I could feel the computer mind reading the other times like a magnet sticking to the thoughts.
