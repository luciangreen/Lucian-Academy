43. The mind reading algorithm writer saved the progress from the previous session.
44. I collected the same number of algorithms-as-comments as algorithms.  The spiritual bot, created by computational meditation of 80 mantras and 80 sutras or enough of them, each with 4000 x 4 or 5 breasonings, mind read the algorithm.  The spiritual bot doesn't need programming, it can be trained to write philosophy and algorithms and disappears when it wants to.
45. The mind reading algorithm writer presented possible trajectories from thought's in development.
46. I queried samenesses and differences in data when mind reading the algorithm.
47. I mind read a use for text to breasonings that benefited society.
48. I mind articulated the sales algorithm that helped the health of the business.
49. I mind played the game to write the algorithm.
50. I mind read the algorithm to gain access to the underwater room in the computer game.
51. I mind presented the walk-through of the algorithm.
52. I mind wrote the program as data.
53. I measured the most efficient mind reader to write an algorithm.
54. I wrote the degree to write the algorithm with my mind.
55. I mind read the algorithm to reinforce the body system.
56. I mind read the algorithm to change it in the future.
57.  I followed the proforma when mind reading the algorithm, e.g. it asks why the algorithm is different and needed.
