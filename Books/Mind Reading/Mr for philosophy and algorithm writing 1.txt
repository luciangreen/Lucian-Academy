1. I mind projected the screen asking for the philosophy and mind read the philosophy.
2. I mind projected the screen asking for the algorithm part and mind read the algorithm part, where I joined top-down and bottom-up parts and data flowed as far as possible as I went and I could fix errors.
3. I mind read the bird's philosophy and algorithm to help him to have a family.
4. I mind chose the specific variable, possibly displaying its value, predicate from autocomplete or the bottom-up predicate to connect to the top-down predicate.
5. I blocked in additional conditions for the algorithm by mind reading.
6. I mind chose combinations of different logical structures when writing the algorithm.
7. I mind chose the suggested three or more lines when writing the algorithm.
8. I mind read the algorithms in the essay for A+.
9. I mind read the algorithms for details in the essay for 100%.
10. I mind read the statistics blocking experiment (to find a possible correlation) data while mind programming, for e.g. variable and predicate naming style, modularisation preferences and preferred data structure.
11. The mind tutor asked questions until the mind programmer discovered the necessary programming technique.
12. I used mind program finder to reorder the data items to match the required output.
13. I mind debugged the errors in the algorithm, e.g. brackets mismatch, singleton variable or singleton in branch.
14. I used mind formula finder e.g. to find the difference formula."]
