1. I mind read that the civilisation's main pedagogy writer needed to time travel to maintain his positive functional writing path.
2. I mind read the comment and sent the replying character to the time.
3. I mind projected the prayer to switch off digestive system pops from practising the sutra, and set up a transmitter that prevented digestive system pops at the time (I switched off the sutra).
4. I remained safe using popological onness (sic) about mind reading for time travel travel.
5. I mind read the best time travel excursion time and place according to multiple perspectives and how the destination helped achieve teaching objectives about the topic 'automation'.
6. I mind read for non-deterministic possibilities (algorithmic back-tracking) for time travel to experience enough details.

8. I mind read the circumstances before sending the spiritual bot through time to bring the person back to life.
