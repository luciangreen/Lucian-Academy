Louis determined the actual time to bear a child on 8/8/80 at 8:88 (9:28 AM). He chose the morning to increase the quality of medicine and possibly to indicate work rather than anything else. This was 9 months (280 days) precisely. All the eights symbolised luck or pedagogical power. Louis gave me an A for the remaining eights (the second, milliseconds). According to ChatGPT, the entire time conversion of 8:88:88:88:88:88:88:88:88:88:88... is 9:29:28.088088088088088088088088088088.
