Doctor Sutra 4 of 4

31.    I prepared to have spiritual prerequisite training for my job by meditating. I did this by switching off genes and precursors for diseases. First, I meditated on the day I was paid to work, produced a spiritual result (H1) or was famous, before I was paid to work, etc. Second, the meditation teacher helped me switch off diseases or, in fact precursors for markers for (or things that might become) diseases. Third, I had a great day. In this way, I prepared to have spiritual prerequisite training for my job by meditating by switching off genes and precursors for diseases.

32.    I prepared to cover all As in the world. I did this by switching on specific As in Theology. First, I wrote the Specific As in Theology A. Second, I breasoned it out. Third, I prepared to write the sentence A, so that I would have an A for each sentence that I wrote.
