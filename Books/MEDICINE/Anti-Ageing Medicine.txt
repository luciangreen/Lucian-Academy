1. Proper medicine required 4*50 As. I prevented ageing using body replacement and pedagogy.  I stopped ageing at the age I saved my body.  My body's state was saved and it didn't denature or degenerate.  I could live forever.  
2. A doctor tested my blood and physical condition.  My body's state was saved from the first day, and could be tested medically.  One set of 4*50 As was for immortality.  Another set of 4*50 As was for anti-ageing.  I wrote about the positive medical effects.
3. I thanked the educational institution for supporting anti-ageing.  Like with body replacement, I could breason out As with or without a computer.  I could use text to breasonings to breason out an A, then indicate anti-ageing each day.  Alternatively, I could hand-breason out breasonings (in my mind) and receive the benefits of anti-ageing.  I could hand-breason out texts if a company couldn't support it.
4. I noticed that a Complexity subject covered medicine.  I attended the educational institution to support anti-ageing.  It helped me write arguments.  I received As that helped the techniques work.  The educational institution provided a course that supported my writing and its effects.
5. I planned my career, and aimed to produce great works.  I could halt ageing.  If I went back to another character's age, I would get older.  My skin and hair remained the same, everyone thought I looked young.  My agent was happy that I hadn't changed my appearance.
