21. I prepared to collect data for Block 2 (female) for those who don't laugh.  I did this by reporting the statistics from the observational study to compare whether laughing prevents depression in those who do and don't laugh treating gender as a blocking variable.  First, I collected data for Block 1 (male) by random allocation for those who laugh to compare whether laughing prevents depression.  Second, I collected it for those who don't laugh.  Third, I collected data for Block 2 (female) by random allocation for those who laugh to compare whether laughing prevents depression.

30. I prepared to collect data for Block 2 (female) for those who haven't practised the Quantum box/prayer technique.  I did this by reporting the statistics from the observational study to compare whether headache, education mistake, muscle ache and unwanted effects of excess breasonings, incompatibility of virality with conception, pimple, unwanted thoughts, hallucinogenic appearances and depression are prevented in those who have and haven't practised the Quantum box/prayer technique, treating gender as a blocking variable.
