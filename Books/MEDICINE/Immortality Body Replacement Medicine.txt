1. With the additional anti-ageing argument, I was immortal.  The trajectory of the body's use repeated when it was replaced.  The body had the same state as when it was saved.  It was as healthy as then.  The heart was in the same condition.  
2. My body regenerated.  My body systems remained the same.  The heart pumped blood with the same strength.  The muscle, lung and blood cells were the same.  The body replacement changed my body to the saved one.
3. I had medicine for pedagogy, meditation, computer science, writing, text to breasonings, mind reading, time travel and immortality.  My body systems were healthy.  If they had a problem later, my body went back to its former state.  I felt happy and healthy.  I could avoid degeneration of the body and its diseases.
4. I could take care of meditators.  I trawled through the idea of the body.  I started with the top of my body.  I knew that my body had been replaced in one go.  I relaxed.
5. I avoided pathogens.  I turned immortality on.  I could avoid sickness.  With enough As, I could help myself and others in time.  I avoided risks.
6. I could meditate on having my body replaced with or without a computer.  I automatically breasoned out As with a computer.  Text to breasonings may stop working without company support.  So, I developed my company to support it.  Or, I breasoned out ten breasonings per day per A of the 80 breasonings written at the start.
