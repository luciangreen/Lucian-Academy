Here's the spiritual treatment.

I have dry eyes.

I like dry eyes.

I like each dry eye.

I'm yours, not sad.

I'm not too happy.

I'm not too sad, just normal.

I am sane.

Chorus:

I eat the food to regenerate.

I will be ready for the next time.

I like the recursive nut and bolt idea

That dries my eyes.

You are loved.

Your friends will make your day great.

Di' di' di'

It's like being a movie star.

I like working.
