Two Uses 19 of 30

180.	ALEXIS: I prepared to be the best in the group of essay writers. I did this by writing the article with others. First, I helped the hermaphrodites. Second, I asked him a question. Third, I examined him.

181.	DION: The subject shouldn't differentiate the same point about the object in the essay (where the subject wrote the piece with others, like being given or giving the object with one hand and writing with the other).

182.	ALEXIS: The subject should write about time and space about the object in the essay.

183.	DION: Two uses is correct because of the dialectic-continuity of nature, which is correct because the subject should write about time and space about the object in the essay.

184.	ALEXIS: I prepared to reinforce realism. I did this by including the secondary text in the bibliography. First, I wrote about the primary text. Second, I read the excerpt in the secondary text. Third, I confirmed what I wrote in the primary text in the secondary text.

185.	DION: The subject shouldn't include 50 As in each book (where the subject included the secondary text in the bibliography, where the text was one that was like an object that he carried with a wide-enough handle).

186.	ALEXIS: The subject should include 50 As in each book.

187.	DION: The subject should write 50 As of continuous dialectics in each book.

188.	ALEXIS: I prepared to read the comments. I did this by including a primary text in the bibliography. First, I found the bibliography. Second, I knew about first wind. Third, I examined myself.

189.	DION: The subject shouldn't lift necessary weights (where the subject included a primary text in the bibliography, where the primary text was represented using a handle narrow enough for carrying with a hand). ALEXIS: The subject should lift necessary weights.
