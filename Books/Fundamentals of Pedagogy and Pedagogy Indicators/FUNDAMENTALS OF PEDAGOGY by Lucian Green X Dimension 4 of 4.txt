31.                 I prepared to breason out 50 As for a text to make it high quality.  I did this by stating that peace is non-questionable.  First, I explained meditation terms in terms of philosophy terms.  Second, I helped the meditator (student) each step of the way.  Third, I critiqued the meditation (philosophy) texts.  In this way, I prepared to breason out 50 As for a text to make it high quality by stating that peace is non-questionable.

32.                 I prepared to serve the roasted rhubarb with tofu ice cream.  I did this by roasting the rhubarb.  First, I picked the rhubarb.  Second, I cut it into small pieces.  Third, I roasted it.  In this way, I prepared to serve the roasted rhubarb with tofu ice cream by roasting the rhubarb.

33.                 I prepared to plan the algorithm before the argument.  I did this by stating that the algorithm will cover the entire argument.  First, I wrote the argument.  Second, I wrote the algorithm.  Third, I covered the argument with the algorithm.  In this way, I prepared to plan the algorithm before the argument by stating that the algorithm will cover the entire argument.

34.                 I prepared to transform a contrection (sic - connected and contra-) into a reason.  I did this by stating that the algorithm will be uniquely interpreted.  First, I wrote the algorithm's predicate descriptor.  Second, I wrote 5 uses for this predicate.  Third, I contrected (sic) the predicate's uses with 5 ranked breasoning algorithm descriptors.  In this way, I prepared to transform a contrection into a reason by stating that the algorithm will be uniquely interpreted.

35.                 I prepared to replaced the idea with itself.  I did this by stating that the idea was important about Pedagogy X.  First, I wrote the idea in terms of Pedagogy X.  Second, I wrote about it in terms of itself.  Third, I replaced the idea.  In this way, I prepared to replaced the idea with itself by stating that the idea was important about Pedagogy X.

36.                 I prepared to write 5 As for the programmer job description.  I did this by naming the co-author of the algorithm.  First, I focused on a single frame.  Second, I asked the co-author to write the simple algorithm.  Third, I asked her to write comments on the algorithm's predicates.  In this way, I prepared to write 5 As for the programmer job description by naming the co-author of the algorithm.

37.                 I prepared to rank and structure both the example sets of data for the algorithm's predicate and the breasonings chapter's algorithm ideas.  I did this by naming the co-author of the argument.  First, I wrote the breasoning chapter.  Second, I thought of the example set of data for the algorithm's predicate.  Third, I connected the example set of data for the algorithm's predicate and the breasonings chapter's algorithm idea.  In this way, I prepared to rank and structure both the example sets of data for the algorithm's predicate and the breasonings chapter's algorithm ideas by naming the co-author of the argument.

38.                 I prepared to eat with the Friar.  I did this by relating Pedagogy X to breasonings.  First, I wrote how breasonings excalibur (from King Arthur) was at the forefront.  Second, I wrote how the suscicipi (sic) was bright.  Third, I wrote how I inhaled.  In this way, I prepared to eat with the Friar by relating Pedagogy X to breasonings.

39.                 I prepared to go for a walk.  I did this by drinking from the water bottle.  First, I suscicipid again.  Second, I helped Robin Hood find food.  Third, I helped them go home.  In this way, I prepared to go for a walk by drinking from the water bottle.

40.                 I prepared to interest the master in the student's breasonings.  I did this by writing the breasoning.  First, I made Maid Marion's day brighter.  Second, I loved the cup.  Third, I loved the mug.  In this way, I prepared to interest the master in the student's breasonings by writing the breasoning.

41.                 I prepared to state that there was nothing there.  I did this by noticing how gravity helped me swallow the ice cream.  First, I inverted the mistaken relation from the dream.  Second, I did this with a chain of 20 items.  Third, I found Bs (As) to mistakes (thoughts) after this.  In this way, I prepared to state that there was nothing there by noticing how gravity helped me swallow the ice cream.

42.                  I prepared to classify the sentence as a generality or a specific example.  I did this by designing the pickies as pairs of generalities and specific examples.  First, I found the picky.  Second, I found the generality.  Third, I chose relativism.  In this way, I prepared to classify the sentence as a generality or a specific example by designing the pickies as pairs of generalities and specific examples.
