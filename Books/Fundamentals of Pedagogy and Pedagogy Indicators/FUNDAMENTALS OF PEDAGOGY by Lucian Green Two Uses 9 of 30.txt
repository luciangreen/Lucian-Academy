Two Uses 9 of 30

81.	DION: The subject should calculate the mark as the number of breasonings and sentences agreeing or disagreeing with them that he writes in the modern pedagogy format.

82.	ALEXIS: I prepared to calculate the best possible time spent rasping, listening to the speech. I did this by writing Michel Onfray's probable comments on Richard Dawkins' probable comments on the line 'I did this by writing the text-to-speech algorithm' for the algorithm idea 'I did this by writing the text-to-speech algorithm' in the Computational English argument in Computational English. First, I calculated the best possible time spent leaning (sic), writing the text. Second, I figured the best possible time spent casually reading the text. Third, I calculated the best possible time spent upholding, saying the speech.

83.	DION: The subject shouldn't direct the student to a way to improve her grades in future (where the marker detected that the student's mark, like the height of the base of the bottom of the object, was below the number of breasonings in the marker's recording).

84.	ALEXIS: The subject should direct the student to pedagogy.

85.	DION: The subject should verify that the student has collected the pedagogical ways of thinking, studied meditation, medicine, a pedagogue helper writer, creative writing and education to write her pedagogical arguments.

86.	ALEXIS: I prepared to write that the lips went well together. I did this by writing Alexius Meinong's probable comments on the Press Release for Richard Dawkins' probable comments on the line 'I did this by writing the text-to-speech algorithm' for the algorithm idea 'I did this by writing the text-to-speech algorithm' in the Computational English argument in Computational English. First, I wrote this spiritual format business is that the computer is just speaking. Second, I wrote each two of the cells went well together to approach human-likeness in text-to-speech. Third, I meditated (was given 50 As) to make sure that my expression was perfect.

87.	DION: The subject shouldn't write that the base exists (where the subject wrote that the lips went well together, like verifying that the base exists).

88.	ALEXIS: The subject should write that the base exists.

89.	DION: The subject should direct the student to pedagogy after the student has written that the base exists.

90.	ALEXIS: What is one use that this program verifies?
