1. I entered the moonlight (got a second job).  I was a historian.  I visited the United States.  I started my career.  It worked.
2. I kept all kinds of meditation techniques.  I wrote the most important ideas.  I wrote the ideas.  I checked the ideas.  I checked the connections.  I kept the science.
3. The thoughts led to sales.  I wrote on the history of mind reading.  It was the best-known software repository.  I counted the breasonings.  I offered thoughts.
4. Instead of time travelling to after my death to work out the best philosophies, I examined all information.  I wrote on the history of education.  I found the essays the teachers had worked on.  I found the discoveries.  I found my path in life.
5. I published the work.  I ate an apple per day (breasoned out 10 breasonings) in meditation.  I expanded my awareness.  I felt active.  It had been prepared for by the historian.
6. I solved the differences.  I breasoned out 20 differing breasonings in business per day.  The pathways were clearer.  There was a discovery with each client.  We parted as friends.
7. I increased the act to medicine (food, a hug and mind reading).  I performed the lecture preparation.  I mind read the comment.  I responded to the comment in the lecture if the student made the comment.  I followed it up afterwards.
8. I customised the solution.  I wrote 10 breasonings per day in teaching.  Both and I the student had 10 breasonings per conversation per day.  It was also for thoughts about comments during lectures.  I worked on a long-enough feature of the interpreter as the seen-as version for the assignment.
9. I wrote the history of happiness.  I wrote 10 breasonings per day for happiness in medicine.  I noticed what the student had got up to.  I wrote the seen-as version for it.  I wrote detail algorithms.
10. There was as government history campaign.  I searched the Upanisads and philosophy for answers.  I found that time travel was a medicine (anti-viral) technique.  I found that mind reading (for writing to be thought of) was a medicine technique.
