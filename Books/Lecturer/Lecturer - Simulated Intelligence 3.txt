1. The seen-as version connected with the other.  The seen-as version is the first depth applied to the idea in the simulation.  It actually was a seen-as version for the idea.  I recorded the algorithms worked on.  I used each algorithm for the feat.
2. I checked it was unused.  I finished the sentence with the simulation.  I found an idea in nature.  I connected to a comment about it.  Some were theories.
3. One person agreed, the other disagreed.  I finished the topic with the simulation.  I simulated the character.  I listened to her make a comment.  I found the best conversation pair for the topic.
4. It was intersubjectivity.  I finished the book with the simulation.  I mind mapped all necessary content.  I worked out more around an algorithm.  I used a system to cover the area of study.
5. I chose the life and science.  I simulated the lecture with a function.  I described the variables used by the function.  I described the values of the variables.  I gave examples of the use of the function.
6. I verified the simulation.  I verified reality with the simulation.  I found the evidence.  I found whether it properly supported the idea.  I found positive function.
7. The connections were in the text.  I was good in the simulation.  I wrote the algorithm.  It checked the good.  Other algorithms came from it.
8. There was enough in the idea.  I tested the that the developed idea test was successful.  I wrote about the developed idea.  I worked out the logic.  I worked out the cycle of improvement for the idea to be above.
9. I read the essay again.  I verified that the sentence was correct in the simulation.  I wrote the sentence.  I found 10 reasons for it.  I checked it's grammar.
10. I printed the report about the simplified sentences.  I applied the second department to the sentence in the simulation.  It was computer science.  It was statistics.  It was machine learning.
