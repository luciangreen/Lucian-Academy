1. It was logical to teleport the time machine, which used quantum power, to the house.  I wrote the new logic.  Quantum power is a big thing when the conclusion is arrived at.  Nature goes around, wait, the time machine stays in the future.  In fact, they have one (is it in the house?).
2. Why does their language sound like ours?  I wrote the new language of logic.  They might have installed the time machine because I was friendly and wrote the Time Travel book.  Everyone can write on time travel.  Time travel will be available to everyone.
3. I found the change within the line.  I wrote the formula.  I uploaded the software to the site using the command line.  The changes were uploaded.  Changes in lines were uploaded. 
4. I wrote the machine learning algorithm that incrementally tested the features and constantly compared the given output with the desired output.  I wrote the formula finder.  I found the repository's version history.  I listed the changes.  I kept all the files intact.  Alternatively, I kept the changes to the files.
5. I worked out the input that the algorithm could take in testing given the difference in the file.  I wrote the input.  I found the differences between the files.  I found all the same parts.  I found the different parts.
6. I changed the algorithm.  I wrote the output.  The checkers automatically checked the output.  The algorithm analysed the algorithm.  It compared it with correctness.
7. It did it by itself.  I applied new logic to the problem.  I found the different possible inputs and outputs.  I wrote the Prolog algorithm that uploaded to the server.  I tested the inputs and outputs and saved them on the server.
8. People could connect to the API using the command line.  I applied new logic to the formula.  I wrote the software-as-a-service (SaaS).  I wrote the algorithm.  I put it on the web site.
9. It generated and ran lambda code.  I wrote the unit of input.  I wrote a site, GitEnv, SaaS which one could download.  It predicted, suggested and helped with features.  It added the lambda module.
10. I simplified the aim to a single idea.  I wrote the unit of output.  I tested by guessing input and output.  I worked out the required changes.  There were tutorials in creating Sent Mail Transfer Protocol servers with Prolog, creating subdomains with Prolog and creating a server with Prolog.
