8. I wrote both new sentences and new connections.  I wrote on philosophy (Computational English).  I wrote on the philosophy of state machine art.  I wrote on the philosophy of computational music composition.  I wrote the connections between them.
9. I reversed connections.  I wrote on politics.  In anarchy, I wrote on new words.  I wrote on new combinations of words.  I gave detail.
10. I read who the customers were in copywriting.  I wrote on English.  I found the sequence of algorithms.  I mind read the story.  I mind read the essay about it.
11. I found the right word.  I wrote on linguistics.  I wrote the rule in simulated intelligence.  It was easy to generate algorithms with a large database.  One read was before writing and one was afterwards.
12. Computer science wrote for me and played music summarising it to me.  I wrote on computer science.  Eventually, all of medicine covered the whole population with pedagogy.  The database helped prevent mistakes in life and new frontiers.  This included time travel.
13. I noticed that the recurring features were able to predicted.  I wrote on psychology.  I checked that art of walkthroughs in computer science was clear.  The language was on the topic.  Relations were clear.  New features were simplified and visualised.
14. I researched the new meditations.  I wrote on meditation.  The humanities research was generated.  The algorithms were generated.  There was always something new.
15. Nature didn't necessarily require algorithms.  I wrote on medicine.  The seen-as version for meditation was medicine.  Meditation was humanities.  Ideas were in the form of necessary connections to help people.  Interfaces were intuitive.
