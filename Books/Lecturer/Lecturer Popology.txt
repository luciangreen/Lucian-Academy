1. There were bank reconciliation and financial statements.  I stated that the person was just.  I connected the sentences with the LSTM.  I connected the sentence to the argument.  My company and the recruitment organisation made a profit, where short courses could be audited for free.
2. The philosophy of popology led to a whole academic career of induction.  The person was happy.  The short courses were optionally free.  The person applied to the course.  She applied for a fee waiver.
3. The application helped the student clarify his goals and helped the academy automate applications.  The person was sentient.  The application site used the K-Nearest-Neighbour algorithm to check that the applicant agreed with the aims of the academy, wanted to study a field within the academy, what they would bring to it and optionally their career aims and ways they would use their knowledge.  It asked for resubmission after negative terms without qualification, i.e. asked them for a solving term after a term such as disagree.
4. There was a certificate, awarding the full version (which was the same as for auditing).  The person was sapient (wise).  The diplomas could be paid for or audited for free.  I tried for industry as well.  At least, the student was protected.  
5. Some details went viral.  The person was agreeable.  Accreditation turned off more than five As per part of the body per day.  Sales included an algorithm and were up to 50 As.  They were sketched out.  The student was tracked.
6. The image had seven parts.   I met the standard.  The Queen was satisfied by the details.  She ate the food.  She played and slept.
7. The teacher critically held the algorithm or found three details. I smiled.  The PhD was supported to do the work.  There were colours afterwards.  Everything worked.
8. The metaphor was supportive and could be left.  He refreshed his appearance in his mind.  He wrote details as As.  He mind read details for writing.  He mind read details to help thoughts return to work, or stay at a relaxing port.
9. I decided to write a lengthy algorithm with a simple philosophical description in Master and PhD.  I weighed up each side.  Logic connected the details to make the algorithm.  I mind read the connectors.  I mind read the connection (e.g. on the fifth day, fifty philosophy algorithms with three details had been written and the cloud requiring 50 algorithm As lifted).
10. He likes University.  I made an allowance for a new point of view. University was fifty algorithm As for a backlogged course for an industry event.  I found lots of relevant perspectives on computer science.  The new student recruitment company found the students.
