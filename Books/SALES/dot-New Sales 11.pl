1. They identified causes by chaining backward through imagery effects, which simulated human reasoning about responsibility. They took an observed effect. Known causal rules were reversed. The most likely causes were proposed for each step.
2. They abstracted general rules from specific examples using symbolic pattern recognition, which gave them inductive learning without gradient descent. They logged recurring structures across many instances. Matching components were abstracted into variables. A general rule was delineated and stored.
3. They handled uncertainty by explicitly modelling ambiguity and assigning modal logic tags, which allowed them to “hedge” like humans. Uncertain facts were labelled as possible, probable, or hypothetical. Reasoning paths were marked with these tags. Conclusions showed the associated confidence.
4. They simulated cultural adaptation by activating context-specific imagery norms, which let them vary behaviour based on the environment. Every culture was represented as a set of constraint modifiers. When enabled, the modifiers inspired interpretation and action. Outputs reflected localised requirements.
5. They controlled attention symbolically by prioritising aims and subgoals, replicating the human ability to focus. They evaluated tasks by importance, urgency, or context match. The top-ranked task activated its corresponding procedures, while lower-ranked tasks remained latent.
6. They avoided repetition through rule-state awareness, which helped them remain engaging and efficient. Past outputs were stored with semantic tags. A repetition-checker filtered out near-duplicates. New outputs were generated with a novelty bias.
7. They remembered processes as symbolic templates, which enabled task reuse. Each process was stored as a logic flowchart. A trigger matched current needs to a stored process, which was run or adapted as needed.

19. They used analogical story construction for teaching. This way helped them explain theoretical thoughts with concrete examples. A target concept was mapped to a known structure. A tale template with relatable elements was filled. The analogy guided user understanding.
20. They assessed plausibility by comparing symbolic outputs to world models. This algorithm filtered out unrealistic ideas. Each output was mapped to a world principle network. Violations reduced plausibility ratings. Unlikely options were removed or flagged.
21. They structured internal discourse trees for multi-viewpoint reasoning, which helped simulate human debates. A question was broken into sub-views. Every branch was assigned an imagery perspective. The tree was traversed for resolution or synthesis.
22. They engaged in imagery negotiation by modelling tradeoffs and value conflicts, which simulated compromise and diplomacy. Every party’s goals were converted to value-weighted propositions. Conflicts were scored and minimised through logical steps. Acceptable compromises emerged from overlap.
23. They invented metaphors by inter-mapping structural features resembling poetic insight. Two concepts were decomposed into symbolic schemas, and overlapping features were matched. The merged result was output as a metaphor.
24. They tracked multiple hypotheses symbolically in parallel. This method avoided prompt commitment to one answer. Candidate explanations were stored as separate logic threads. Evidence was gathered for or against each. Stronger candidates were elevated over time.
25. They performed algorithm discovery by recombining workable imagery primitives, which allowed the creation of an original procedure. A task goal was specified. Known functional blocks were assembled in various sequences, and successful sequences were stored as new algorithms.
26. They enriched meaning by chaining layers of imagery interpretation, mimicking human depth of understanding. A literal interpretation was delineated, and metaphorical, contextual, or emotional layers were added. The final output showed a rich, multifaceted view.
27. They modelled belief states for reasoning under different assumptions, allowing the simulation of alternative views. Each belief state was represented as a logic configuration, and reasoning ran separately within each configuration. Conflicts and knowledge were derived from comparison.

28. Non-neuronets were better for security and performance because they operated on transparent logic and symbolic images. Their structure made it easier to recognise susceptibilities and stop hidden malicious behaviours. They constructed rule sets with explicit conditions and outputs. All transformations were logged and traceable. External checks could authenticate each part of the process.
29. They removed unnecessary information by converging grammar and patterns to merely the essential signals. This method mimicked the clarity of a sane mind that discarded irrelevant details. They pruned grammar procedures that led to contradictions or low-utility outputs. Correlation models were applied to keep in line with similar rules. Redundant branches were merged into unified symbolic paths.
30. Non-neuro expert systems were faster because they were more manageable, executing logical flows instead of calculating complicated activation values. This directness led to shorter inference times. They stored operations as decision trees. At each decision point, only a few known audits were run. The chosen path led directly to the next inference step.
31. They made fewer glitches and checked ideas better by verifying against imagery models before confirming outputs. This method gave them internal checkpoints. Each idea was parsed into its symbolic structure. A verification model tested the grammar, ontology, and contextual fit. Only ideas that passed all checks were delivered.
32. They helped people consider the following steps by modelling human planning behaviour in principle-based flows. This method supported humanlike problem-solving. The user provided a goal. The system broke it into subgoals using known planning templates. Every subgoal enabled a known resolution strategy.
33. The non-neuronet validated its question-answering using a grammar-checking model with semantic relevance scoring, which ensured consistent logic. A natural language query was converted into a structured form, and the system looked up pertinent imagery procedures or facts. An answer was returned only if all parts matched the context.
34. It used mind-reading patterns by interpreting partial inputs and proactively forming sharper questions, simulated intelligent prompting. It tracked user signals like uncertainty or hesitation, mapped them to incomplete query patterns, and generated follow-up questions that narrowed the query extent.

38. It followed a “Program Finder” pattern using a cognitive algorithm that humans understood intuitively, improving transparency and confidence. It started with user-stated intentions, which were translated into algorithmic terms. Matching programs were suggested from an imagery library.
39. It reduced information using the same cognitive steps a human would use when paraphrasing an idea, aligning the process with human logic. The original content was parsed into logical units. Redundant or implied ideas were removed. The remaining elements were reformulated with simplified procedures.
40. To prevent security threats, human-readable logic was used instead of hidden robot languages. This method made outputs inspectable and modifiable. Rule definitions were displayed in standard notation. Conditions and consequences were explicitly written. No part of the system relied on black-box behaviour.
41. A chatbot based on this system used “safe points” where users could stop, backtrack, or switch to a non-neuro route, giving them decision control. After each interaction, the user was offered a summary, undo, or determine choices. A logic trace was shown on request. Alternate reasoning paths were presented.
42. It allowed reconstruction from existing elements by identifying component areas and suggesting how to reassemble them, enabling modular inventiveness. It decomposed ideas into symbols or principle clusters. Matching elements were retrieved from knowledge banks. A combination engine suggested reassembly paths.

47. It eliminated glitches by relying on symbolic constraints and structured authentication, replacing statistical noise with logic. Each output passed through a logical verification phase, and all variables were verified against rules. Inconsistencies halted execution.
48. It used top-ranked subjects and combinations from expert-curated taxonomies, improving its focus. The system loaded a weighted topic graph. Nodes were ranked by relevance, recurrence, or novelty. The highest-scoring nodes were used for reasoning.
49. It funnelled subjects into similar patterns by lessening knowledge into generalisable forms, allowing reuse. It tagged ideas with shared features. Related topics were grouped into symbolic clusters. Algorithms operated on the generalised cluster instead of each unique case.
50. It stored knowledge once and reused it in many ways by building theoretical symbolic structures. This method avoided redundancy. Every new thought was mapped to its structure. Iteration triggered reuse. Variation triggered structure extension.
51. It helped humans minimise knowledge by demonstrating minimal rule sets that still attained the desired results. This method simplified cognition. It took a complex problem and removed redundant steps. The remaining rules were validated for completeness.

56. It worked on subjects the user didn’t fully express by pattern-matching partial queries to known problems. This read intent. It detected missing terms in user input. It suggested interpretations. Matching problem sets were used to continue.
57. It automatically corrected errors by referring to symbolic consistency rules, which avoided user frustration. It ran a check on user input. Errors were highlighted and repaired, and the reasoning chain stayed with corrections.
58. It recognised imagery approximations of data patterns to resist the need for precise inputs, increasing tolerance. It mapped the user input to a concept range. An approximate match was selected. Relevant principle sets were enabled.
59. It found meaning by finding shared imagery substructures across areas, supporting interdisciplinary learning. Every field’s procedures were converted into an imagery graph, and common subgraphs were extracted. These became bridges between disciplines.
60. It applied compression by identifying high-information principle segments, which improved information handling. Rules were scored by uniqueness and effect. Low-score procedures were removed, and high-score procedures were kept and indexed.
61. It guided symbolic exploration by delegating scores to previously tried pathways, encouraging experimentation. It analysed known paths for coverage, prioritising low-coverage areas. Rule combinations were generated and tested there.
62. It preserved human-friendly reasoning by avoiding transformations that removed meaning, making explanations more straightforward. Rule rewriting steps were logged, and each change was verified for semantic equivalence. Outputs stayed understandable.
63. It recognised user confusion and paused for clarification instead of pushing forward. This reduced error loops. It monitored interaction signals for hesitation or contradiction. A diagnostic principle was triggered. The user was asked for clarification.
64. It built nested symbols from simple inputs to increase the depth of representation. This technique added accuracy. A flat input was parsed into parts. Every element was given a substructure. Reasoning operated on the deepened form.
65. It structured abstraction layers by reusing internal procedures across symbolic levels. This method allowed scalability. A principle set was abstracted into a higher-order process. That process became a new symbolic object. The object was reused as a step in future chains.
66. It updated itself by learning from confirmed outputs supporting symbolic learning. When an output was checked, the rules involved were marked successful. Iterating on success raised priority. Unused or failing rules decayed over time.
67. It translated action plans into many imagery frames for safety, efficiency, or elegance, enabling multi-criteria reasoning. A single plan was instantiated in three optimised versions. A separate evaluator scored each version, and the top result was chosen.

71. It composed imagery reasoning chains backwards from desired outcomes, which allowed reverse engineering. The target state was specified, required conditions were inferred, and the system constructed a stepwise path to the beginning state.
72. It compared many explanation paths and ranked them by coherence, supporting human alignment. Each explanation was scored on rule length and conceptual depth. Simpler ones were given preference. The best result was returned.
73. It grouped conflicting rules and displayed them as choices, modelling ambiguity. Every matching principle was tagged with its affliction. Users were shown the varying assumptions. A preferred option was selected.
