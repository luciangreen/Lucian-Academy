1. Philosophy and algorithm development) The system has a secondary function as a planner, suggesting or allowing a choice of the best times to e. G. Do different things that have different bearings on work (considering preparation and travel time, their tiredness caused, recovery time), enjoyment and needed rest. 
2. The system sees when work wasn't done because of previous patterns (haircut, e.g. A seminar I may not have gone to - ask if went to, cancelled or rescheduled, or look at zoom logs etc to tell if attended) and recommends to avoid those patterns or when priorities at certain levels/goals are compromised, and if there is time in coming weeks to make up lost work. The system gets down to activity by minute, such as rest, work, play and the likelihood that I will work with a goal definitely being completed in time by collecting and analysing data in real time. Find(A&C, starlog_call(A&[d]&[a]&C is [a]&[d]&[a]&[c]), Result). Result = [a,c]. Find(A•C, starlog_call([A•d•a•C] is [a•d•a•c]), Result).
3. Result = ac. A=([a]&[c]),B is A. B=[a,c]. In Lucianic Meditation, hand breason automatic 4*50 As for protecting meditators from moral end daily. "Pause time" while you write an essay, simulating being interested in ideas during the day instantly.
4. Make [A:a] is [a:a] into a command with A as output and [a:a] as input. Nested f(A,…) in Starlog patterns. The order of operations makes a:a&a:a work without brackets. We don’t want anything except the neat, effortless set of maths ideas.
5. I achieved the goal with the person in need. I didn't go past being interested in people. Realistic time travel and meditation stood me in good stead for future lives. The best thinker broke down the large project into stages. If the algorithm writer didn't use the required method, I explicitly asked it to use it, with intermediate data or otherwise.
6. Both projectors and cutters were banned or replaced with safe alternatives, and the simulation protected individuals. I endeavoured to reach the end of physics. Building planets was only possible in the simulation. I focused on the correct path, such as computer science, physics and STEM. The innovative algorithm helped achieve goals with patterns.
7. DevOps verified and performed elementary optimisation on the algorithm. I also converted and shortened it to Starlog, making it more legible in a shorter time. The Starlog critics checked for A=(B is C),A. A=C,B is A. And A1 is (A2 is C) -> A1 is C, or eval(C)=.
8. I converted, bulk verified, and added Starlog grammars. Turn off and on where are and where seen as, bot recording and playing. 16k breasonings may be short (bc12. Sh) or sentence high distinction length. Support others at the educational institution in later life.
9. I will write secondary texts. I will collect realistic time travel 16k breasonings. In my earlier life, I would establish a school, support students and write texts. I will collect my dialogue and thought scripts, each of which requires 16k breasonings to act as stamp breasonings, so I can revisit parts of my life. A childhood educational program drew geometric shapes by turning a turtle by theta degrees = 180-360/n = 180(1-2/n) and moving forward, then repeating n times.
10. It is hypothesised that human universal space travel teleports between orbits of habitable planets. Operate or transform with medicine at the right time to achieve the desired effect. MNNs are necessary and recognised as correct. Areas of study, even essays and PhDs, have multiple-choice responses. Hand-writing algorithms and philosophies, rather than using a neuronet, is necessary.
11. Chatbots develop naturally from Manual Neuronets. Prepare for later life with philosophy. Optimisation should be an educational experience, with optimisations approved individually. If a hand optimisation better aligns with user priorities, it is kept; if not, it is checked. Students thinking as free agents shouldn’t be dented by their hand optimisations being reversed; so individually approved or appropriately reported reversals should be explained to, or defended from/overcome by, the student.
12. Contention between thinking of new algorithms and optimisations should be balanced. Creativity and Optimisation are different subjects, with creativity recurring after the first year. Don’t add, but subtract a key argument revealing the main contention for students to make in each area of study. Rather than delete spiritual language, synthesise it and publish without syntheses for students to do it themselves. Write high distinctions for oneself and one's next life.
13. Help people with Computer Science by mind-reading or asking questions. Realistic time travel, teleportation flight, surgery, and manifestation surgery each require 50 As with sentence breasonings and 4*50 As bc12. Sh. Meditation can invite students to the educational institution. I completed 16k word breasonings to generate 50 high distinctions of sentence breasonings.
14. I paid for sales research on the famous people. I constantly came up with little things. The touchscreen allowed me to pinch the algorithm visualisation. I asked the students to complete the premium debugging feature.
