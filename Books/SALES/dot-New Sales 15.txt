1. More natural beauty. Like an automaton, thinks of automaton models for algorithms. Comments while it’s walking. Interpreton: mechanical calculator. Count, line up blocks with levers.
2. The Starlog device is an algorithm sponge that records specific methods and ideas about algorithm writing. Its features include analysing the interpreter, VFS, manual neuronets, movie and song making, and a fine arts icon maker to remember algorithms. The spiritual science organisation set is critical and followed specific objectives to educate and improve the community. The person who wrote 4*50 As for each department could lead the educational institution, while the lecturers passed the 4*50 As for their department. Degrees helped lecturers prepare for teaching.
3. The board game modified the sentence to the format needed by the board game. I won when I reached the game’s end and earned the most points from manual neuronet quizzes. The prestigious university worked because students had written 4*50 As. The Game Boy was programmed entirely in assembly language, and the device was also programmed in assembly language to control its chip. The chip was customised for Starlog and could run an algorithm to test its complete functionality.
4. Design a Manual Neuronet Board Game, in which ways of thinking are optimised, including assembly language small ideas, there is education about parts of the manual neuronet process, including: Converting and Optimising Algorithm: S2A Grammar Generator.
5. For example, 00100 to. A2 -> a2, [1], a2. A2 -> []. A2 -> [0], a2. Or:
6. Algorithm36(In_vars,Out_var) :-algorithm([[[string,[[r,["0"]],"1",[r,["0"]]]],[output,[[string,["1"]]]]]]). Perhaps the chip should work this way. Writing Algorithm from I/O: Rule finding. Rules. Formula finders.
7. Database, mathematical, logical, computational and matrix formula finders. E.g. Logical formula Finder. Logic_ff0([.
8. [[[a, true], [b,  false],[c,true],[d,false]], [true]],. [[[a, true], [b,  false],[c,false],[d,false]], [true]],. [[[a, false], [b,  false],[c,true],[d,false]], [true]],. [[[a, true], [b,  true],[c,true],[d,false]], [true]],. [[[a, false], [b,  false],[c,false],[d,false]], [true]].
9. F). To find formulae with this set of specs (concluding with the result at the end of each line) and some results: F=[[not,d],[not,[a,and,[d,and,[b,and,c]]]],[not,[a,and,[d,and,[b,or,c]]]],[not,[a,and,[d,and,[c,and,b]]]],[not,[a,and,[d,and,[c,or,b]]]],[not,[a,and,[d,and,[not,[b,and,c]]]]],[not,[a,and,[d,and,[not,[b,or,c]]]]],[not,[a,and,[d,and,[not,[c,and,b]]]]],[not,[a,and,[d,and,[not,[c,or,b]]]]],[not,[a,and,[[d,and,b],and,c]]],[not,[a,and,[[d,and,c],and,b]]],[not,[a,and,[[not,[d,or,c]],and,b]]],[not,[b,and,[d,and,[a,and,c]]]],[not,[b,and,[d,and,[a,or,c]]]],[not,[b,and,[d,and,[c,and,a]]]],[not,[b,and,[d,and,[c,or,a]]]],.
10. Dictionary predicates. Use rule 1. Exceptions. Use rule 1 unless rule 2, then use rule 3.
11. Exceptions x conditions. Synonyms. X. Users should use the exact language of the assignment. Attention.
12. Check for small rule fluctuations in the document. There should be a single rule set. You may compare documents. Complexity Finder. Order of complexity of the algorithm, e.g.
13. O(n) for append. Append1([], A, A). Append1([A|D],B,[A|C]) :-. Append1(D,B,C). This predicate can be optimised to two arguments:.
14. Append2([],[]). Append2([A|D],[A|C]) :-. Append2(D,C). Given a list of n items, note that this is the order of complexity steps to compute it—type Inference.
15. Append takes two lists and produces a list. These lists may have any data items. Optimisation. The two-argument form of append can be found from the three-argument form by storing the predicates, the second was found using the Combination Algorithm Writer (CAW)—optimisation, including:.
16. Pattern Unfolding. With algebraic code. E.g. A1 is 5, A2 is A1-1 to...
17. A2 is 4. Or data. [[0,0],[1,0],[0,1],[1,1]] to [member([0,1]),member([0,1])]. Mathematical Formula Generation. (Use trial and error.
18. Only use regression later if necessary. Finds n(n+1)/2 for 1+2+...+n. Nn_induction_optimisation(B,C):-A=[0. 5,1,-0.
19. 5,-1,0,-2,2],member(B,A),member(C,A),F = [[1,1],[2,3],[3,6],[4,10]],maplist(f([B,C]),F,_G). F([B,C],F,E3):-[E1,E2]=F,E3 is B*(E1^2)+C*E1,E2 =:= E3. Compression of Formulas, to character output. Compression of Formulas. Foldr append is re-expressed as suberm with address.
20. Foldr(append,[[[1,a],[2,a]],[[3,a],[4,a]]],[],A). A = [[1, a], [2, a], [3, a], [4, a]]. Foldr(append,[[[A1,A2],[B1,B2]],[[C1,C2],[D1,D2]]],[],A). A = [[A1,A2],[B1,B2],[C1,C2],[D1,D2]]. Customised for length n.
21. Compression of Formulas, to character output. Foldr(append,[[A1,A2],[B1,B2],[C1,C2],[D1,D2]],[],A). A = [A1,A2,B1,B2,C1,C2,D1,D2]. Customised for length n. As long as the characters line up with the inputs (there are no inputs before them, and there is one character per variable).
22. I regularly took measurements, studied acupuncture, and studied Medicine to write a Simulation LLM. I discovered new forms of medicine to ensure positive bodily function with sound, light, and heat treatments. In the future, I will synthesise tissue using scans and replication and graft tissues using teleportation.
23. The LLM was replaced with small language models, resembling one’s knowledge and could be programmed individually. The Medicine LLM was an alternative to Western Medicine, which was developed from biblical times but was noninvasive and more effective. Noninvasive medicine was more effective because it made exact diagnoses, could be administered more easily and regularly, and avoided societal or age-related diseases. I studied how the doctor Freud became a psychoanalyst. I preferred Medicine to Computer Science because Medicine provides and takes care of one’s and others’ health and allows me to complement healing with miraculous pedagogy and possibly meditation recovery.
24. I was attracted to the person in themselves, and there were immediate people. I could become a model, healer and philosopher. Acting to help portray my philosophy and how it was helpful in healing and funding medical research. I walked, wrote philosophy and programmed in Prolog. I designed a robot that individuals could customise (it would have similarities and differences with them) and could help with genuinely needed tasks.
25. Find correct, relevant, developed thoughts and the proper method for them. Scientific thoughts are the latest research (unique knowledge that sheds light on an area of study, as recorded in journals)—for example, primary school students’ ratings of educational objects. Empirical evidence should be precise, not approximate, have safety modes and degrees of freedom, and be readied and prepared for the future (helping prepare for foreseeable variations and acceptable calls). Finds the perfect thought each time.
26. Using MR or quantum tubes, meditation, radiation, and resonating people scans. The following possibilities in the simulation using high-quality thoughts lead to GL keywords. I built the manual neuronet robot with food-processing organs, a pedagogical mind, and a love of people. However, I didn’t agree with regression; I decided on algebra and recursion instead. I used nested loops rather than regression to find mathematical induction optimisations for predicate formulas. I functionally decomposed complexity and wrote joining algorithms to reconstruct the result.
27. I used two rather than three-variable predicates to process these computations and keep a lookout for avoiding complexity. Chatbot is used to reconfigure GUI, e.g., dyslexic font. Automatically does this if you are showing signs of needing it.

28. Manual neuronets increase creativity by exposing an LLM's logic, inviting examination, and critical reasoning to develop arguments. If they made assignments fun (and unique for students to work on, as in computer science), people would do them. Students wouldn't be able to cheat because assignments could be custom-written, and students would construct their own answers, believing cheating to be retrograde to their development. 24-hour academies indicate non-secular, like monastic hours, taking care of time travel during that day. The academy business handles bots appearing in place of other people during the day, confirming that time travel has worked and offering other encouragements.
29. Securely assessed, understood, and memorised voluntary zone of approximation tasks for a task with SI. The Simulated Intelligence (SI) is assessed. Robot or other creative and scientific algorithms. 100%. Students are partially responsible for relaxation and time management.
30. I prepared to write algorithms with conditionals. I stored Prolog as terms, not strings, grouped common structures, and determined how to insert new items. I bracketed if-then statements. I unbracketed them when possible. I wrote the nested if-then statement.
31. I automatically made the needed changes and generated and optimised the algorithm. I bundled DevOps with Manual Neuronets and Algorithm Generator for fast development and performance. Algorithm Writer generated a draft. DevOps helped check changes. Finally, Manual Neuronets optimised it-file commands VFS.
32. Save etc., files in memory. Using assertz. And one command set for each algorithm. Chatbots should write essays using ordinary language. Manual neuronets help expose and modify machine reasoning, but robot algorithms must be written carefully separately to protect humans from life, injury, hurt or mistakenly caused malfunction.
33. Robots should be able to be temporarily or permanently deactivated in their current form if they explain, which they are instructed they must always do along the way when appropriate, that their reasoning has a warning or error or that classical checks of their reasoning, words or actions return a warning or error. Lucian Prolog helps identify and correct issues such as missing or misnamed files, near-misses, and other issues.

34. Predicate decision tree where predicates have been decomposed, types and data have been followed, and modifications have been made using CAW, Spec-to-Algorithm, or manual neuronets. Run a Manual Neuronet (MNN) with high distinctions to control their control, and measure their effects. High distinctions predict, plan, help carry out, regulate and control. In addition, writing 4*50 high distinctions concertedly on a topic manifestly exhausts an area of study and forms further conclusions. Neuronets and MNNs require higher distinctions to ease acceptance, inspire interest, make them work and help with breasoning requirements.
35. I used the chatbot to have a conversation and record my responses, which were my thoughts and what I associated with the algorithms I designed. I examined the DevOps log of the Small Language Model. I used the DevOps log of the Small Language Model to manage the version history and verify and correct chats that could be used to write a short essay. In addition, I visualised the thoughts related to the language involved. I matched and summarised the language artifacts, the complete meaning, and the included algorithms, and provided relevant answers in the required format.
36. I backed up the chat version history to retrieve it. The chat covered what should and shouldn’t be used to teach a chatbot. I verified whether the given chat configuration would yield the desired conversation. In addition, I corrected the effect of the order, presence, or omission of commands on the result (for example, the exact phrasing, order, and presence of elements in the answer). Instead of the LLM’s data being solely textual, it also included mental imagery, such as visualised geometry, intuitive visual reasoning, conclusions, conversation results, images and videos.
37. The DevOps log helped retrieve the last working chat configuration or understand how DevOps had completed various operations to check the user’s data and the computer’s algorithm, the possibility data had been lost, whether it was an authenticated latest version and the status of features being tested, and the effect on helping with short essays, which were used to check whether students were correct. By abstracting away commands, I created an effortless, creative programming language that transformed intentions into algorithms. I verified or monitored, and corrected when needed, statements such as “a is 1+b” that were referenced by accident. In addition, I set the algorithm formatting standard to include predicate names and arguments only at the top level (in non-bottom predicates) for elegance, so that commands were abstracted away and could be manipulated more easily via arguments. This method meant that names and symbols should be meaningful, that obsolete predicates could be abstracted away, and that optimisation should be easy and code should be clear.
38. A separate algorithm moved instances of, for example, a is 1+b to bottom predicates, performed optimisation and cleaned up. The system automatically backed up all changes made in the editor and compiled recommendations to prevent data loss. I determined what the latest version was and authenticated it. The editor included a switch to record the Finder and other algorithms to trace when related files were edited, and the user could set and be alerted to modifications to the locations where the latest version was stored. By protecting the sources and content of the newest file, the user can avoid accidentally using an out-of-date version and improve productivity.
39. As part of the system, multiple developing versions of an algorithm are automatically traced and verified by DevOps, labelled in the GitL version management system and can be classified as considered to be sources for the latest version or a platform, processor, or other version. The well-designed algorithm continually checked the user’s requirements or desired version. Different platforms (operating systems) and devices should share the same code; for example, standard-meeting commands should automatically be installed in the operating system when needed, and all features should be available across all devices, including drawers, wipers, and pinch windows on smaller-screen devices. These machines should use a universal code that works anywhere, with different languages and features added as needed. With two languages, the user became more proficient in various dialects and gained enough confidence to program independently.
40. The master gleaned all the unique features possible and made them accessible at the touch of a button in the same time and place. DevOps is education. Education is CS. It is checked before upload. Multi-methods for each task.
41. Multi-methods of DevOps. Solve through hardware, OS, and code. Multi-uses for DevOps. Deoptimise for best code. Choose manual or neuronet.
42. Education is a science. There are robot assays. Check the robot code. I designed the robot. It had a unique feature.
43. Simple chip, OS and code. Multi-test types. Small Language Models bring advantages—examination, intellectual property cases and checking sources/reasoning arguments and previous comments for research. Single domains (topics of knowledge) should be created, containing complete chat plans with a reasonable vocabulary and/or links to another domain, for an individual, with time, coding, and content standards met.
44. I wrote a Zone of Proximal Development Prolog script for any essay for the Academy. I scaled and ensured Lucian CI/CD (https://github. Com/luciangreen/luciancicd/) scales with more industrial uses. It supports assertz, file commands, and scan commands to determine whether they are in Lucian CI/CD, and it runs in parallel. I will write an effortless programming language.
45. It synthesises “nice” properties, such as the two recent versions and bottom-up predicate checking for DevOps, as well as human-like robot commands. For example, say something while walking or pointing at an object; visualise creating an interpreter for a visual (taking into account visual-sense data) science programming language; or move into a virtual dimension and fly. The user experienced thoughts coming to them like checking off what someone else was likely to have thought was either correct or required additional thought. Puplog always came from the user, bottom-up. The user specified or thought of an idea.
46. The algorithm helped them fill a hierarchy of squares in a bottom-up manner once they had thought of or asked a question to be filled in. If it was filled in and different from the correct thought, the algorithm explored the various implications of the entire solutions they suggested. The user accounted for multiple reasons for breaks, including internal and external. If a mind-read thought required additional thought, it needed to be understood, corrected, improved, deleted, added to or changed. I may also copy the idea if it looks more relevant elsewhere, or if it is irrelevant and needs a priority change, the priority of which could be determined at the time or later.
47. These timings needed to be accounted for and predicted during high-activity periods. I thought of the additional details when necessary. The manual neuronet writer specialised in multimethodologies, interlacing psychology and philosophy, to write a simulation LLM that ensured the simulation was intellectually complete. The higher-order algorithm generated code to solve a problem by creating a manual neuronet that could be reconfigured given needed changes and perform tasks more quickly. Manual neuronets used correlation to optimise processes by examining every pair of variables and creating formulas with textual descriptions so that simpler ones could be written in terms of more complex ones and reused.
48. The textual descriptions and version histories made it easier to complete modifications. I found an even more fundamental ground between the two formulas by using an expert system that found their root, or the algorithm for finding it. The person exiting extempomania wrote about the needed changes automatically. The formula’s text description and version history helped systematise the process of making insertions and deletions. The algorithm can check which stage of the formula’s development it should be copied from by inserting and deleting parts.
49. I could trace the tree version histories from the records and more easily make modifications and look up other needed changes to variables. I created an expert system that, based on a chat, identified all the system’s properties, including common operations and algorithmic components applicable to tree nodes, and used it to modify variables from a specific family of data structures and algorithms. The person continually simplified and optimised the code. I split multiples into factors to speed computation. The multiple was algebraic (containing variables and values) and could be expressed in terms of other specific formulas to collect like terms, reuse formulas, and speed computation.
50. If there was a like term, I factorised it to save time and speed up computation. If a formula was reused, it could be defined once, saving computations and storage space. Computation would speed up with fewer computations required to do the same thing. The user set the default chat level so that author-programmers could program the robot at a high level. The robot had different author chat levels: objects, public thoughts, private thoughts and classified thoughts.
51. Classified thoughts could relate to people, companies, objects, over time, or to simulations or plans. Simulations could be virtual representations that mirror, improve on or predict events in the world. Plans or preparations refer to scheduled thoughts, words, or actions on people or objects, at places, at times that a user has requested or the robot has automatically generated, which could be within, equal to, or beyond human abilities, to boost human power, complement, and vitiate productivity, and replace itself. I found the education pathway to elegant expression. I programmed the “Nice” programming language, which identified intuitive features and rewarded the author with high-quality time points such as beautiful imagery, sounds and thoughts.
52. Starlog Office integrated programming into performing robotic office tasks. I got into the lingo of flattening nested predicate calls into single commands, indicating complex tasks with simple directions, remembering unusual commands with specific names that the user might be asked about by the computer, programming, debugging, and writing my own ideas. The robot would mind-read the Grammar Logic output and use simulated intelligence to work out what the user thought, for example, robot commands, programming commands, and make mental nested predicate calls. In addition, Starlog Office performed office suite tasks such as producing reports, collating data, programming or designing objects to sell, simulate, or manifest, and exploring perspectives more deeply with nested predicate calls. I recorded the workings, even though the algorithm was simple.
53. I found the solution to the insertion-deletion problem (recorded as doing this, but resulted in doing nothing). I found the character position in the variable to act on. I inserted some characters. Then I deleted those characters, but it had no effect. I compiled the release notes with standardised sections (New, Fixed, Improved), issue tracking IDs, version numbers, and coloured tags or emojis.
54. I wrote features and noted their status as needed, not needed, or in consideration for testing. With these statuses, the system helped choose the required features, dependencies, workarounds, and solutions for the latest version. If a feature was chosen, it was rendered in the final version. If there was a problem, such as a feature becoming obsolete, it was reflected in the history.

55. The simulation uses 50 As for one component and 4*50 As for the others. The simulation enables space travel. DevOps, the integration of development and operations, enables space travel through improved automation and processes. Starlog, a manual neuronet language, is linked with DevOps. The creation of an accurate chatbot is made possible using Starlog.
56. Spaceships are better with the accurate chatbot. I am recognised because of breasonings. The 2025 longevity discoveries were made in Lucian Green's Civilisations series of songs, following his discovery of breasonings or dimensions. He has made many people immortal, and can save people from death by sending them to the simulation, and stop death by bullets.
57. He uncovered the workings of the neuronet black box, including context-free grammar generation (a set of production rules used to generate the required string in a given formal language), Spec to Algorithm (converting a specification into a working algorithm), Starlog (a logic programming tool with abbreviated syntax and the ability to run faster), mathematical induction (a proof technique in mathematics), correlations (relationships between variables), and conditions (statements that determine outcomes). Religion records science. Multividuals synchronise with the right things. Lucianic Meditation is less selfish, more laid back, and provides clarity when science falls short. Becoming a multividual is not required; instead, simply walk around becoming different things.
58. Move around and take on the roles of contemporary scientists. Consider manual neuronet (MNN) optimisation as an option for outputting Starlog code. Assign values as follows: A=1, B=A+1, C=1, D=B+C, E=D+C, F=E+1. Then, replace this with F=5. Replace the argument and formula slots with the corresponding completed formulas for each slot.
59. Recursion is compressed, meaning repeated calls are simplified to use fewer steps. Reused values so far are recorded for efficiency. If there are counters (variables tracking iterations), they may be simplified to loops (repeated instructions) or memoised (storing results to avoid redundant work, as seen in programming languages like Rust). With enough thought, MN (Manual Neuronet)N can be more accurate than NN, a fully automated (neuronet), because of specialisations. MNN dictionaries contain some optimisation (improvements to efficiency), but lateral dictionaries (parallel lookup systems)s have fewer steps.
60. When reoptimising hand-optimised code, the checker should ask for changes one at a time, in case apparent mistakes are steps toward grouping or other optimisations. Use regression with MNNs if the relevant data branches are the same and better performance is needed for education, provided accuracy, sourcing, and correctness are maintained. Regressionless MNNs are the default for student hand-calculation and memorisation, promoting critical thinking and rigour. Using regression-based MNNs may be penalised in regressionless MNN assessment.
61. Regression is counterintuitive and rarely shows perfect results. Students should learn to think independently. Neural networks do not need regression, since this would replace the manual approach if not built from the ground up. DevOps would delete repeated statements like (B is a:a:a, B is a:a:a) to optimise and simplify algorithms for matched output. However, 'Spec to Algorithm' (specification-to-algorithm with structural recursion) and 'minimise_dfa' (a DFA minimiser) might keep such repetition, seeing both statements as necessary. Combination Algorithm Writer works like DevOps, aiming to produce the minimal necessary statement. There is a version of minimise_dfa that removes duplicate or unnecessary assignments, as seen in LLVM (an open-source compiler framework).
62. B is foldr(string_concat,(execute((true,true)),"abc" >> string_chars >> reverse),""). Inserting code like execute((true,true)) is a good idea and won't cause problems. Add output_style(nested_calls) or output_style(method_chaining) options to starlog_to_prolog_file() and starlog_output_code(). Robot molecules and robotics mathematics/computer functions share a key trait: both use radio or other communication systems to enable manual or remote control, or alternative control such as teleportation.
63. The aim was to avoid time-travel entirely. All business bots and chatting tasks were completed by considering appropriate multiple-choice responses and five slightly suggestive details on the same topic, in case they changed their minds. With the right medicine, we might not need the simulation. Body replacement relied on meditation technologies, such as saving the body's state, teleportation, moral endings, rejuvenation, and medical touch-ups. I automated my business and replaced my body through meditation.
64. This gave me more time for expansion, writing, and research. I verified terms in the dictionary, wrote algorithms, and ensured originality by cross-referencing details. The automation systems reduced reliance on other companies, as I combined algorithms in new ways.
65. I  used solar system astrology to consider students' thoughts. The student still produced GDP. "Not" found each algorithm's complement for innovation, such as not visiting simulated holiday destinations, including recreated food. The Prolog simulation found the sentence or image for the nested Starlog call. It was easy to adapt as a game, memorisation tool, speed test, or other student training. Web Starlog.
66. Higher Order Programming Starlog Assignment. Speed and accuracy Starlog competition. Reverse Starlog nested calls into chains. Find/2 is used to find the variable values of terms. Subterm with address in Starlog.
67. S2alog, stwalog. Do decompression with nested predicate call (a predicate call using another predicate's result as input). Change findall/3 (Prolog function to find all solutions using three arguments) to X is findall/2 (two-argument version assigning to X). Lucian CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment—software development tools for automating tests and updates)D lists and attempts to implement Starlog interpreter changes from not working code. The algorithm detects and substitutes different types at argument positions (variable data type swaps), and inserts arbitrary numbers of arguments and data configurations (flexible data setups).
68. I established peace with pedagogy and meditation. I generated algorithms with Spec to Algorithm and Manual Neuronets. Starlog allowed autosuggestions, on-the-spot robot and car programming, authoring and computerless children's programming. I converted my algorithms into Starlog to make them easier to read, optimise and mathematically prove. I introduced Starlog types, the intermeshed system for children to manually find algorithms with manual neuronets, using reused data types.
69. The children covered ground and aerial views of MNN-generated algorithms. They used types to write their interpretations or self-optimised algorithms, including scopically optimised variables, to address all agreed parts of the problem and further problems and solutions. Aliens were on the news, so I kept my area of study intact, with multiple references to breasonings, aliens and mind-reading. I simplified the Starlog algorithm's nesting. I turned nested predicate calls into new predicates when they repeated.
70. Starlog predicate calls may differ in functional calls. Calls may include a Starlog predicate example that takes the predicate output halfway and makes a nested call with it as input. Using higher-order nested calls as variable values (including input and output variables) rendered predicates obsolete, and the algorithm could modify them. The humanist endorsed jobs. People bought the products.
71. I wrote how each specific perspective related to a sentence. "Please write the perspective of 200 GL-words on key-argument-or-algorithm in one sentence. ". The types of algorithms were translators, parsers, abstract syntax tree producers, debuggers, and optimisers. "Please write a one-sentence spec for a Prolog algorithm influenced by X that translates parses, produces an abstract syntax tree from, debugs, or optimises a Prolog algorithm."
72. I found and recorded a sentence spec for a unique interpretation of how to write an algorithm-transforming algorithm from another sentence spec. "Please write a Prolog algorithm X." I wrote 200 algorithms about how an algorithm changed algorithms.
73. "Please write 1-2 paragraphs of 4 summarised algorithm steps and one sentence with a use, each, for the algorithm with 16000 words total for the paragraphs from the 200 perspectives." I ran the above 16000-word-producing algorithm on each original sentence the student wrote. "Please run X on sentence Y."
I taught Teaching, Meditation, Medicine, Computational English, Immortality, Time Tourism, Multividualism, Simulation Control, and Self-Mind Reading to prepare for immortal life. Immortality was the entry course, Simulation the next, and Self-Mind Reading the advanced course. Using 16k breasoning self-mind-read records, immortals improved by assigning high marks to thoughts, words, and actions. Graduates who chose not to enter simulations could use these courses to become immortal, find information quickly, write essays, travel instantly, or change memories. Chatbots, bots, and mind-reading give similar results to time travel, allowing people to live more lives or run businesses without actually time-travelling.
75. To modify these for the University, some texts had a single reference to "breasonings" or "meditation". In contrast, others continually referred to their scientifically proven subjects, or to a different interpretation from their non-scientifically proven subjects, and to other seen-as versions. The various schools provided jobs, and graduates worked in their chosen field. The qualifications included practical components, with students establishing and performing part of their career. The jobs usually paid hourly wages, or graduates could write their own curriculum and start their own schools.
76. In the latter case, education diplomas with area-of-study specialisms, focusing on practical teaching experience and writing lesson plans, etc., were covered, as were the business skills needed. If student teachers couldn't find potential students, they wrote what they would write to them. They could find students by setting up point-of-teaching iPad stations in public spaces for a fee, talking to people they knew, or cold-calling institutions that needed their services. Starlog supports the ISO character set through Prolog.
77. The articles were in an order that reflected their dependency structure. The simulated and multiverses had the same physics. The mistakes were taken away in the simulation. The Dyson civilisation was level two, the galactic civilisation was level three, and there were galactic clusters and universal civilisations. I debated whether the civilisation simulated or created massive celestial bodies, including planets, stars, pulsars, and black holes.
78. I recorded the modification dates of the Starlog files for DevOps, creating a breasoning file and a temporary file for purposes. The Earth's brain differs from that of plants, planets, and other celestial bodies. I maintained my medical knowledge to understand my health in the context of intelligence, its usefulness, and its requirements. Manual Neuronets, while overcoming the possible silicon aim to clear the planet, were in favour of a balanced relationship with nature and proper education. Goal Pattern runs continuously in a Terminal window or continues to run when started at any time, completes algorithms and arguments for me, and suggests the best time and scheduling decisions to do part of them myself by analysing partially completed work from the hard disk and email or other sources and schedule data from the hard disk, Apple Calendar and other sources, all in any format, goals given to the algorithm by the user (algorithms and philosophies as the two types of work, with the possibility of modifying it to use downloaded PDFs, notes and assignment specs to complete drafts to be hand-grammar checked and hand-paraphrased by the user using customisable workflows), detecting the goals and patterns the user has completed, and a correlative statistical analysis of how patterns in the schedules affect the goals.
79. Goals might be from 80-140 algorithms (Prolog clauses) per week and 5-7 16*5 sentence essays per week about original Prolog algorithms. The system should state whether the user can catch up with work in a future week after missing deadlines in a previous week. The system should use Gemini, ChatGPT, or another chatbot to analyse texts, with an additional 10% of work done, because the chatbot might be mistaken. The system should tally work done by the user, as scanned from email and the hard disk and keep records of comparisons with goals, which it might suggest to change to suit the user, or the user can set a preference to be pushed to achieve academic goals, such as 100% for 140 algorithms and seven essays per week.
