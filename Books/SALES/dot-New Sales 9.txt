New Sales 9

1. The salesperson increased the real-time operating system with manual neuronets. I wrote a manual neuronet optimiser that laid out all the data, used a decision tree, found up to the answer only, and possibly cut out unnecessary searches. Manual neuronets, found with an algorithm, were neuronets with visible algorithms that prioritised decision points and quickly found types of outputs for inputs. By checking the manual neuronet's algorithm and making changes to its parameters, such as separated cases or clarifying conditions or other data, where the effects of changing the neuronet on output were shown in real-time, the neuronet could be perfected with more test cases or a test case generator, and the changes saved in an S2A spec. The test case generator needed to verify whether specific lines of code did or didn't need types of test cases generated from them, where the generator could suggest connected tests for individual nondeterministic lines to save space, using variables containing other items and shortcut algorithms, mainly for printing.
2. The salesperson optimised any algorithm. A manual neuronet running CAW tried dictionary items in response to reading the spec. The manual neuronet running the interpreter simulated the algorithms it ran, not the interpreter, although it could also do that. The manual neuronet could predict the results of a depth-first search by the interpreter, using correlations to find the correct output for the given input. Complicated algorithms needed to be run using time-slicing algorithms.

3. The salesperson optimised compiled choice points by using loops. When compiling S2A specs into Prolog or converting choice points into loops, I found the context-free grammar for the algorithm, looping around (a copy of) the larger of the existing recursive structures. It is just an algorithm, so there would be finite loops. This method should negate the need for predicates, reducing the algorithm to a recursive spec. This code can be compiled in C, assembly language, or a chip.
4. The salesperson stated that S2A’s conversion to context-free grammar absorbed different entry points in predicates. Combining the predicates, converted the code to recursive structures, pattern matching and the remaining code. Superfluous commands, such as those operating on trees instead of lists, could be optimised. I could more easily optimise the spec formed from merging predicates, preparing for manual neuronets by skipping over unnecessary computations. Manual neuronets didn’t overfit but returned the required result after finding it with the minimum computation, requiring an accurate algorithm to convert the algorithm to a manual neuronet.
5. The salesperson found the manual neuronet with a human-written algorithm rather than a neuronet, which may need to be more accurate. To convert the algorithm to a manual neuronet, an algorithm that required accuracy needed a 1:1 correspondence between the algorithm’s spec and the manual neuronet’s spec. The manual neuronet skipped unnecessary computations if a condition found from a correlation, possibly found from a chain of similar skipped to computations, was met. Finding these parts, unlike a neuronet was long and required exhaustively finding computations and their prerequisites top-down. However, this step could be optimised, like S2A, by skipping unnecessary computations (not needed in the list of independent variables), replicating text found elsewhere or quickly computing another way.
6. The salesperson merged conjunctive and unit production groups and used distinctive groups that they kept and reused code, but conjunction and other groups were needed if they reused code. S2A finds recursive pattern matching and code loops, and Starlog could omit choice points and have loops instead. Groups of reused pieces of code and their dependencies were merged and optimised by only keeping disjunctive relationships. Any lone groups were moved back into the main code. A utility helped the user edit the code by pretty-printing the code and “ploding” (sic) or simplifying the code structure to make changes and insert or delete parts by moving groups from and to the main code to the separate code and forming, checking and simplifying groups.
7. The salesperson claimed that groups could contain recursive structures and other codes and permanently removed choice points by using loops and self-references, which didn’t create choice points by converting “non-deterministic” clauses to mutually exclusive conditions of a function. Multiple solutions usually generated by findall, maplist, foldl and foldr were found by converting these predicates to recursive structures with loops replacing choice points, expressed as fast code in a compiled language. Choice points included multiple clauses and non-deterministic calls to predicates with various clauses and cuts. However, they did not include single or numerous self-referential calls, which required a separate function area. Optimising slow code using choice points, like Mercury, required changing to deterministic or non-deterministic code in suitable cases by removing finding non-deterministic (multiple solutions) in the case of deterministic code.

8. I found what made mortals buy. I made a sale for the customer in return for purchasing my product. I made money with business by understanding enough algorithms. I designed a creative writer for algorithms. There were one, not three, copywritings to test for a sale.
9. There were two short commerce courses to reuse high distinctions that had yet to be used. So, n copywritings = n sales. Owners still can’t see bots. They can turn them real with 4*50 algorithms and turn them off similarly. For example, 4*50 breasonings were breasoned out by bc12.sh.
10. I turned customers real with 16k breasonings. For example, when using the vaporiser, I minimised tasks (writing, thoughts and behaviour) and gave 16k breasonings to each idea. I performed each thought’s 16k algorithms and turned them real to me. I used the neuronet for a minimum of two high distinctions for thought and two high distinctions for realisation. Humans need advertising and bot customers around them.
11. The academy needed advertisements to attract humans. I wrote a converter from Prolog to Starlog. I wrote that “v” in can be customised 
[(spaces)v(spaces),(spaces)Prolog_vname(spaces)]. There was no a=b(1) or b(1). If there was one output, the call can go directly into input/output.
12. With more than one output, variable names can be used in input/output. If we need the computation but not the output, we always use variables for input/output. [n,b(1,2)] syntax is used for calls. I want to run “var n, A=b(1). A”. I didn’t wish to execute “true”, but the value from running. After A, A=b(C).
13. I made writeln info text blue with a unique blue label and stated this in the documentation. On a separate note, time travel needs 16k breasonings rather than the quantum box stamp repeated. I time-travelled yesterday to activate my bot (the version of me in the present) when I hadn’t time-travelled to become it that day. I wrote two simultaneous short courses in each theatre and
sales for high distinctions to reappear until they were used up. This method was suitable for other people and humans.
14. I introduced Python-style neuronet, matrix and sublist commands into Starlog. I wrote a copywriting Starlog icon argument. As an aside, I developed a Real-Time Operating System (RTOS), which worked out how long each computation would take. It afforded greater than one unit if it finished in time.
15. It was run if the RTOS computation took priority (it was needed and finished in time). I checked for exact output in Shell in the Linux version of the day2  immortality algorithm. I negated predicate specs with pointers to spec containers. I reused parts that may form containers with optimisation. Starlog can have a:a, b=a,a:a, (b=a,a):a or (b,c)=f(a).
16. Starlog can replace a in a:b with length(a,1) or number_to_string(1). Brackets are unnecessary unless needed to compute a value inside a :- (body). The brackets (), {}, [] behave the same way in Starlog and Prolog. Other brackets or “f” are needed for invisible groupings, or rather just (), lists=[], list length=f and code={} or “not”. Prolog should use inbuilt CSPs to prune algorithm trees.

17. I wrote a statistical formula finder that streamlined the process of recognising relevant statistical equations based on input criteria. To use the formula finder, I first programmed it to scan databases for various statistical formulas. Then, I created an interface that allowed users to input their wanted parameters or problem specifications. Finally, I tested the formula finder to ensure it correctly suggested the most appropriate statistical formulas.
18. The statistical formula finder needed separate clauses with distinct formulas to function correctly. I ensured that each clause in the system was programmed to correspond with a different statistical formula. First, I identified all the formulas required and assigned them to unique predicates. Next, I separated these clauses in the code for easy perception and execution. Lastly, I verified that the formulas were accessed when named by their corresponding clauses.
19. The statistical formula finder checked that all variables had been found before proceeding to the next step in the process. Initially, the tool parsed the input to identify variables. After that, it inter-referenced these variables against the chosen formulas to ensure all were counted. Finally, it flagged any missing variables, prompting the user to input or correct them.
20. The statistical formula finder was secure and safe because it confirmed each change with the user. First, it prompted the user to review any proposed alterations. Next, the user had to approve each change before the system executed it explicitly. Lastly, a final confirmation check ensured no unauthorised modifications occurred.
21. The statistical formula finder was secure and safe because it checked the mission objective of reaching a new conclusion and evaluated whether the chosen method was productive. Initially, it assessed the method’s relevance to the mission objective. Then, it compared the result with expected outcomes to ensure the method’s success. Finally, it prompted the user to review whether the conclusion met the objectives.
22. The statistical formula finder was secure and safe because it eliminated pathways that employed incorrect or risky methods. First, the system ran a preliminary check for potential risks in the proposed method. Second, it flagged paths that did not meet safety standards or exhibited errors. Lastly, it automatically excluded these problematic paths from the analysis.
23. I set the operating system’s cycle velocity to optimise its performance. I first assessed the current cycle velocity to comprehend the baseline settings to achieve this. Then, I made minor changes to the cycle velocity to find the most efficient rate. Finally, I ran a series of performance trials to confirm that the new cycle velocity improved the system’s overall operation.
24. I changed the “&” (append) limits series to a series of appends for searching and replacing within a linear grammar. First, I identified all instances of “&” limits within the existing grammar. Next, I updated each occurrence to an append format suitable for searches and replacements. Finally, I validated the changes to ensure they functioned correctly within the modified grammar system.
25. The Prolog grammar command functions like the lambda command and makes calls to algorithms based on specifications or sentence specifications. Initially, I set up the Prolog grammar command to interpret inputs as grammar procedures. Then, I programmed it to match sentence structures or algorithmic specifications. Finally, I ensured that the command implemented the corresponding algorithms when conditions were met.
26. Alternatively, the Prolog grammar command asserted a grammar with a unique predicate identity. First, I devised the Prolog grammar to include a unique predicate for each set of grammar procedures. Then, I included this predicate into the system to be named upon when needed. Lastly, I confirmed that the unique predicate names allowed the system to seamlessly differentiate between different sets of procedures.
27. The grammar served as a verification or processing “goto” algorithm in assembly language. Initially, I created the grammar rules to guide decision-making in the assembly process. Next, I executed the rules so that they directed the program flow according to specific requirements. Finally, I tested the assembly scheme to confirm that the grammar-based “goto” logic processed correctly.
28. Spec to Algorithm could convert consecutive numbers into longer sequences, such as 1 12 123 1234, for any number length. I started by formulating the algorithm to recognise and sequence numbers consecutively. Then, I tested its functionality to handle variable lengths. Finally, I confirmed that the algorithm accurately processed input numbers into the expected output format.
29. Spec to Algorithm efficiently calculated the 1+1+1 and 1* (1+1) formulas. First, I inputted the basic formulas into the algorithm. Next, I verified its ability to perform addition and multiplication operations accurately. Finally, I verified the results to ensure they matched the expected results without glitches.
30. Spec to Algorithm recognised formulas using grammar and the “is” command. I began by incorporating grammar procedures into the algorithm. Then, I used the “is” command to facilitate formula recognition and calculation. Lastly, I conducted trials to ensure the system effectively interpreted and solved various mathematical expressions.
31. In the formula, when one was represented as [a,1] to include further information, it was recognised using a grammar system. I first configured the grammar to recognise complex representations of numbers. Next, I included the ability for the system to read and understand extra information tagged alongside numbers. Finally, I confirmed that it processed [a,1] and similar structures as intended.
32. To change a foldr function, I expanded it into a predicate that replaced the original foldr, made the necessary adjustments, or altered the foldr function directly. First, I analysed the foldr function’s structure to comprehend its role in the code. Then, I expanded it into a custom predicate for greater flexibility. Finally, I either modified this predicate or directly edited the foldr function, ensuring the new logic met the wanted requirements.
33. The salesperson shape-shifted to save her life by wearing a costume and make-up. She realised that her ability to change form allowed her to blend easily into her surroundings. This competency ensured her survival and helped her adapt to the dynamic demands of sales environments. Her transformation allowed her to remain unnoticed when defying potential danger. By taking on different appearances, she could better engage with diverse customers, each with unique wishes.
34. I shared multividualistic customers with my team. These customers were unique in their ability to adapt and seek customised service from many salespeople. We worked together to ensure their satisfaction, acknowledging the complexity of their needs. We expanded our understanding of singular experiences by working together and offering highly custom solutions. This method cherished a sense of loyalty and trust among our customers.
35. I noticed that a University pupil came from another University. This observation revealed that students often sought experiences outside their home institutions. The student's curiosity and willingness to explore new environments provided valuable insights into consumer behaviour. We used this understanding to enhance our client engagement strategies. By addressing the diverse backgrounds of our clients, we improved our communication techniques.
36. A worker satisfied a customer's wish to have a particular product from another store. Going beyond standard service demonstrated our commitment to delivering client expectations. The employee sourced the product efficiently and ensured it arrived promptly. The customer's satisfaction reflected our dedication to versatility and resourcefulness. We treated such landscapes as opportunities to replace or mount content to enhance the overall experience partially.
37. I noticed that advanced teleportation involving non-double bodies was possible based on current and additional knowledge. This discovery opened new permutations for logistics and transportation. We envisioned scenarios where instantaneous travel could transform our business operations. By combining teleportation technology, we could significantly minimise delivery times. This innovation promised to improve customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.
38. The salesperson programmed a sophisticated simulation that created new rooms in the same space, turned off sound, and monitored security. This sophisticated simulation allowed for dynamic reconfiguration of office environments. By managing sound levels and security landscapes, we optimised workplace efficiency and privacy. The simulation's flexibility provided a secure and adaptable environment. Employees could work without distractions while maintaining confidentiality.
39. I made the whole business dimensionally private. This decision ensured that sensitive information stayed safeguarded from outside threats. We safeguarded intellectual property and critical information by taking advantage of dimensional privacy. This method allowed us to conduct high-stakes projects without fear of interference. Our commitment to confidentiality placed us as a trusted leader in the industry.
40. I found the advantages of conducting business privately. These advantages included the ability to conduct sensitive studies and superior planning. By operating in a private dimension, we minimised outside disruptions and maintained focus on our aims. This strategy also managed seamless international alliances. Privacy shielded our operations, enabling innovation without compromise.
41. I founded a private business with a lucid vision. I aimed to create a firm that thrived on security, versatility, and technological advancement. By prioritising privacy, we cherished an environment beneficial to groundbreaking work. Our business model attracted clients who valued discretion and innovation. This foundation laid the groundwork for sustained success and growth.
42. I communicated decisions, practices, and technologies to the board. Keeping the board informed ensured alignment and confidence in our operations. This clarity fostered a culture of responsibility and partnership. The board supported our initiatives, knowing they were grounded in strategic planning. Together, we developed advanced office layouts and version control systems.
43. The seller stated that the superior computer could control shape-shifting. This technology allowed for dynamic control over the exterior of spacecraft. By incorporating lead into the hull, we blocked dangerous radiation. The computer's virtual power supported critical simulations necessary for space examination. These strengths ensured the safety and success of our missions.
44. The multividualistic computation found the object to refer to and attained greater-dimensional computation. This process allowed us to access advanced problem-resolution techniques. By referencing specific objects, we enhanced computational efficiency. The results led to faster and more accurate simulations. This approach significantly improved our technological capabilities.
45. Objects incorporated customised circuits and specialised hardware, which enhanced our ability to optimise simulations. We duplicated on-screen elements to streamline practices and minimise glitches. The use of custom hardware ensured that our systems performed at peak efficiency. This customisation supported complex and resource-intensive tasks.
46. I simulated the system to optimise and speed it up. We refined the simulation over time by basing individual avatars on model objects. This iterative method improved the users' conscious experience, and every refinement brought the system closer to perfection. This optimisation process improved productivity and user satisfaction.
47. To better organise the simulation, I compressed many objects into appearing as one. This strategy reduced visual clutter and improved processing speed. By differentiating between pointers and references, we maintained clarity and efficiency. The compression technique simplified complicated operations and allowed us to manage vast amounts of information quickly.
48. I compressed many objects into appearing as one to organise the simulation better. A second use of this technique was to improve client information visualisation. We created more straightforward and digestible reports by presenting many data points as a unified object. This method simplified complicated examinations, allowing clients to grasp key knowledge speedily. Additionally, it improves user interfaces by lessening clutter and making navigation more intuitive. The streamlined visualisation improved decision-making processes and increased client satisfaction with our services.

49. The salesperson optimally used intelligence to ensure flawless delivery and understanding of goals at the appropriate time. Starlog rigorously assesses bisecting goals and decreases context-free grammar (CFG) development time. One can find details about code by using nested commands with pattern matching and thought or chat commands such as selecting or modifying specific code sections. Goals can be bisected by specs either being written top-down or bottom-up, or if the result is unknown, the rule can be written and the result verified against a phenomenon, or one can start writing a bottom-level predicate and modify it to match the needed or already known output. One may decrease CFG development time by trying to write predicates from specs before the user needs to, by giving possible options earlier for a predicate version that saves time, is most straightforward, and produces the correct result.
50. The salesperson claimed that Starlog was intuitive because it inspired thoughts that were in the moment or had a short handling time. Starlog was aimed at the self, where individual coding temperament was considered in terms of the code (for example, preferences for commands, formats, or commenting style). Personal preferences could be about the code on it (for example, routinely run, closely aligned or suggestable algorithms). In addition, Starlog's coding temperament was considered based on formats or other preferences in thought commands (such as how timing or wording aligns with formatting and recognising a break or types of thoughts). Preferences could be considered regarding chat commands (such as preferred formats or databases of outputs with pricing and accessing a chatbot through a VPS or over SSH at the touch of a button).

51. The salesperson didn't appear; everyone joined the simulation at 18. Some people may avoid the societal push for immortality but present outlying cases if their medical condition deteriorates. Immortality prevents age-related diseases rather than viral or accidental medical problems. Therefore, some age-related diseases may become outlying cases for society if the patient isn't a simulant. Medical advances for these patients will only improve, and they must be kept in touch with other advances.
52. The salesperson designed the simulation to adhere to regulatory standards and best serve its users. The Simulation Design Standards, maintained by a simulation accreditation organisation, would ensure personal safety, security, fairness, and health and that people rally in support of law-abidingness while providing graphical and design standards for emergency protocol and what the person should experience. The Simulation protected simulants' safety by disappearing, colliding bodies, or freezing the person if they were about to harm themselves. The Simulation encouraged simulants to maintain their security by not giving out personal information or being caught in risky situations. The simulation engendered pedagogy as a fair pastime and a way to enable simulation technologies, and this was helped by accredited qualifications and short courses, which encouraged simulations to use pedagogy to activate the simulation technologies regularly.
53. The salesperson knew that taking off and landing were the most dangerous parts of the journey. Like Space System Software (SSS), Simulations should be ratified (meet requirements and pass DevOps tests). Space travel is far too dangerous. It must be simulated, i.e., travellers experience the universe through a simulation with data from object readers by the higher-dimensional computer. Once the journey is complete, the travellers may teleport to their destination.
54. The salesperson agreed that humanness, humility and law-abidingness were superior to extreme absolutism. The journey is not optional or unnecessary but serves as a natural reminder of the universe's sheer size and need for the best technology by humans. It reminds us that humans shouldn't directly benefit from the instantness and infinite power of HDCs when it is more natural to experience space travel. Similarly, instant power and results will likely backfire and lead to catastrophe in the simulation, conversations, bodies, time travel and batch jobs. When broken down into steps in the vastness of the universe, these processes are likely to be sustainable and possible.
55. The salesperson assured customers that the Simulation was safe and safer than reality and supported their goals and heartfelt ambitions. There is a duality of "graphical" space travel and the usual "natural" simulation experience, where space travel may vary but offers an immersive, "graphical" journey on a planet with realistic experiences followed by teleportation to a destination. It could be only teleportation, but the simulation philosophy suggests a more natural, enjoyable experience. The law should incorporate the idea that people need and are supported by nature and that human nature is benevolent and protective. Ethics and a principled background in science will likely lead to the proper regulation of these technologies.
56. The salesperson celebrated using their body instead of skipping over tasks. It's good to move one's body instead of constantly teleporting. So, I teleported in steps to the destination in appearance but really "travelled" in a studio that the simulation was, rather than teleporting instantly to the destination. This method made it possible and more natural. The whole simulation was in something like a studio.
57. The salesperson hardwired the spacecraft. I designed a Combination Object Writer algorithm that finds combinations of circuits, chemicals, and components in a simulation to identify practical, undiscovered circuits and other phenomena. I could use this to find time travel, mind reading, quantum gravity, quantum energy, and other circuits. These circuits may have been the original circuits on which the quantum box was based. Further discoveries and aims could be achieved.
58. The salesperson verified that criminal allegations haven't held up the account holder. Before testing the circuit, I minimised or optimised it. After generating all possible combinations of circuits to test in the set, I removed duplicates and duplicates with incorrect layouts or aimless designs. I chose the simplest circuit that achieved my goal.
59. The salesperson found the best, most innovative circuits. I recorded or compared their effects with a possible list of desired effects. I listed whether each test passed or failed and took notes about it. I listed the simplest or best solutions and any surprises, warnings, or dangers. The simulation meant potentially dangerous circuits could be tested to eliminate them without real threat.
60. The salesperson also ran a universe and multiverse simulator. I simulated the circuit in a physical simulation using past real-world data, calculating each circuit's physical effects and the performance calculated. Like the medical simulation, real-world data powered the simulation, and an HDC tested the results of a quantum simulation to test for all behaviours and properties. This HDC simulated the effects of all particles on all particles, a feat no ordinary computer could achieve. It could even predict behaviour and interactions at the quantum level.
61. The salesperson conducted science using a simulation. I found values to find the circuit with a specific output. This exercise was similar to a constraint satisfaction problem, except that testing involved constructing and testing each circuit, necessitating the simulation. Software sometimes tests for or eliminates values to find the circuit to meet requirements. Similarly, certain relationships were tested for or eliminated.
62. The salesperson used the circuit for commercial or unknown research. I substituted the values that created the circuit back into it to test it. This method tested the circuit, and the simulation worked. I adjusted the values to refine the circuit's performance or for another purpose. I could use the computer to modify the circuit, values, or simulation.
63. The salesperson determined that people uttering meditation utterances were recognised and supported and given rewards. Once I had the technology, I tried to simulate it with the quantum box. The quantum box replaced the hardware and software, including objects, settings, and data. These things could be described as data or copies of a previously configured machine, and they caused the quantum box to give the same results. I used the quantum box like a computer when I couldn't access a computer.
64. The salesperson used many multiprocessor computers to breason out the technological requirements. Time travel and other quantum box technologies required many high distinctions to work correctly. Time travel required approximately 10 billion 4*50 high distinctions to work. Immortality body saving required about 1000 million 4*50 high distinctions. Body replacement needed about a million million. Mind reading requires approximately 10 million 4*50 high resolutions.
65. The salesperson celebrated the uses of the quantum box. I ran the algorithm for two minutes on ten machines with ten processors for a mind-read answer. If I had quantum energy or a spiritual, long-distance network, I could build an elementary HDC. Quantum energy now also works with the right number of 4*50 high distinctions. I could prevent overpopulation problems from immortality.
66. The salesperson used sensors on the instances to shut them down if they caught fire. Mind reading takes the computing seconds that 4*50 high distinctions take (12 years), where the HDC result is instantly available. The calculation is the time for 4*50 high distinctions, including 10 length sentences*10000*1000000=28k days. This step requires an HDC to complete. Or, a classical computer could optimise and complete the algorithm in minutes on a supercomputer.
67. The salesperson said power and distance were no object. The time travel computation takes the same time as the mind reading computation. Body replication takes 1200 days or hours on a supercomputer. The algorithm could use one breasoning based on different things, but using different breasonings from an argument is better. The HDC allows us to do some tasks in the present, not the future.
68. The salesperson examined the universal markets. However, the simulation safety layer requires more breasonings and ingenuity and may require future technologies. In addition, multiple people using these services require an HDC. Space travel is possible with a map of the universe found with teleporting drones. Other planets will only accept visitors from advanced, peaceful planets.

69. The salesperson agreed to help the client to the surmisation software. Starlog Prompt, as previously mentioned, presents a blank screen into which the user has been mentally prepared to enter Starlog algorithms. The user surmised what to write by thinking of handles onto the thoughts they had mastered by thinking independently of sensory cues. The system never exceeded data that was critical to enter and only helped users increase what they needed when necessary. It may have a setting that doesn't increase the finished code if it is annoying or doesn't lead anywhere.
70. The salesperson accessed the alternative dimensions by asking for relevant, ranked answers to questions. I uttered, typed or thought-entered data into the text editor. The object was to enter text described using words, punctuation, or other character names and display it on a screen, a spiritual screen, or by playing an audio text. I checked the input, made sure it was correct, and offered suggestions. I could automatically finish parts of the algorithm, with help from versions of me in other dimensions, timelines, timelines in different dimensions, and other people who would be recompensed with these criteria.
71. The salesperson adjusted conversions to nested Starlog to use loops in nondeterministic predicates with free variables or used an optimisation that collected data first. If appropriate, I converted the unnested Starlog to the nested Starlog when writing in the Starlog Prompt. This action helped reduce the number of variables in the source code and possibly sped up the algorithm when converted to C (but would sacrifice choice points in this case). Findall, one of the only necessary choicepoint commands remaining is a loop and could be converted to recursion. Foldl is another choicepoint command that could be converted to recursion.
72. The salesperson tried completing to-do list items automatically, keeping in mind the dependencies. I counted the saved seconds using the Starlog Prompt screen stabiliser while jogging. The screen stabiliser appeared in front of the screen, not blocking the view of the jogger, allowing easier vocal, thought, and eye control of video listening, testing, and other playback apps. Even though jogging is intensive and distracting, I could quickly run and check the results of tests and other running-intensive applications, such as DevOps, which I could attend to later if they failed. I could run advanced apps that automatically fixed DevOps problems and do basic uploading; if not, I could make vocal to-do notes inaudible and non-lip-readable to others.
73. The salesperson wondered who the most advanced actors were. Starlog Prompt can tell when you're reading the text and offer specialised preference customisation of window activation order, selection stabiliser and specific replacements in text prediction, and make suggestions to change the text, take notes or bookmark progress. Undone notes, unfinished texts or changes that take on additional significance with a later experience or thought of the user can be attended to later, possibly automatically or shelved with progress rewards or retrievable parts signposted for later processing. This method resulted in 100% accuracy in assignments. Films, music or texts could be redone with audience comments.
74. The salesperson stated that hydroponics (with water, like direct help when programming rather than soil-based development) can improve a Starlog Prompt system that helps users telepathically to the point of entering Starlog algorithms. Users can devise a simplified algorithm as the model. Then, keeping this level of simplicity, they could write a programming language that preserves this simplicity while inserting invisible commands where appropriate. These invisible commands might prepare substrate structures for processing data, do non-actual thinking or be deleted because they are optimised, such as simplifying an interpreter to remove choice points or skipping over needless conversions.
75. The salesperson automated what was also checked for security. I wrote a hand-neurooptimiser for the Prolog algorithm. It printed the required number of output characters in terms of merged clauses, signposted and ranked points in data and correlations for non-pattern matching code (except grammar with clauses that can be merged). This intuition-based optimisation was better than a neuronet in cases where unnecessary code or methods were used. Other optimisations from the neuronets could be added on, checked, and studied individually.
76. The salesperson used thought or vocal commands while using their hands to do maintenance. Starlog Prompt wrote the code to control a spacecraft from A to B. For example:
travel(a,b).
Entering the text using non-typing methods is more user-friendly and sometimes is more appropriate in dynamic spacecraft environments.
77. The salesperson used different Starlog Prompt workspace presentation modules to write, debug, test and run in a mobile app. Starlog Prompt could be used to develop the Starlog Prompt software, including accessible input methods, different spoken and programming languages, neurooptimisers, and workspace presentation modules. Accessible input methods may include eye gaze sensors, joysticks, Braille pads, and Dyslexic keyboard overlays. Different spoken languages determined the language prompts were in, and various programming languages could be written using the software, especially conversions from Starlog. Neurooptimisers included different algorithms, suggestions for ways to break into decision trees, the grammar-logic breakdown for expert systems and various correlation types, such as between neuronet elements, to build into hand-neuronets.
78. The salesperson helped pinpoint the two objects to join from the goal. Starlog Prompt found the two objects (code ideas) with objects on the way that the user wanted to join together. These code ideas were, in fact, single ideas that the user could retrieve. They needed to be accessed precisely, using precise language and the simplest terms. The user needed to connect other ideas manually.
79. The salesperson quickly posted the first correct version of the code. Starlog Prompt allowed two or more people to collaborate on documents. While one person worked on and tested one predicate, another could work on an unrelated predicate. Document changes and the version history were automatically saved. DevOps could be used to test the algorithms and find compatible versions.
80. The salesperson entered each predicate spec for the algorithm. Starlog Prompt had inbuilt software verification and submission grading. When each verification test had passed, the software was verified to work. In addition, when each submission test had passed, the project earned 100%. When the project was complete, it was automatically submitted (in some cases).
