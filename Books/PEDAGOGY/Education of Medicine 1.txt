1. The medicine student didn't take risks before body replacement. I helped follow positive function with movement and body replacement. I avoided damage to my body. I moved in safe ways. I remembered to replace my body every day.
2. The medicine student enjoyed continuous positive function of his body. I replaced my body to not have body failure in life. I avoided organ failure. I avoided external sources of damage. I avoided forgetting to replace my body each day.
3. The medicine student listed used and unused body functions. I exercised each part of my body to help me live longer. I exercised my muscles. I used my brain by studying. I avoided stress from overwork.
4. The medicine student did one thing at a time. For example, I aimed to run and perform extraordinary things in life. Therefore, I exercised outside each day. This exercise consisted of a run or a walk. I made goals and achieved them.
5. The medicine student turned off skin growth in anti-ageing. I replaced my body, resetting to ideal physical condition. I continued to feel fine. I forgot any worrying things. My hair and nails grew, and I cut them.
6. The medicine student enabled immortality with accreditation. The medicine student took spiritual preventative medicine for schizophrenia and studied for a Master's in Medicine to prevent schizophrenia and hallucinations. Spiritual medicine turned off particular points in our time. It indicated future medicine. The degree helped with critical and pedagogical skills to turn off unwanted spiritual points.
7. The medicine student helped others to become immortal. I used the psychiatric setting to write high distinctions. I could concentrate well. I used meditation to help write books. I used accreditation to support me in avoiding mistakes.
8. The medicine student avoided stress and did what she wanted to. The woman enjoyed a high quality of life, including studying, by preventing stress. The woman enjoyed talking with high society members. She chose an appropriate course. She worked in this field.
9. The medicine student only did relaxing things. I had the confidence to exercise and lead an everyday life without stress. I avoided heaviness, speed and doing too much. I had time to go outside. I saw friends and walked my dogs.
10. The medicine student relaxed at home. I spiritually replaced my body, preventing mental illness from studying subjects and turning off hallucinations. I was fresh, helping me stay happy. This state allowed me to examine my thoughts. I could do this by choosing to do it.
11. The medicine student started a copywriting business or a newspaper, a medical receptionist, a school receptionist and a meditation/events staff member/gardener for a meditation centre. I found out the requirements in the simulation and performed them in time. I did my things (earned jobs above those I needed or not, and completed pedagogical requirements) and moved on (helped professors). This thought made me laugh. I also relaxed.
12. The medicine student noticed the small things, such as relaxing hands. The person tested that immortality with meditation and body replacement allowed him to add on specific medical questions. I queried possible preventative measures, treatments and other possibilities about each part of my body. I stayed happy. I continued.
13. The medicine student tested my health. I automatically generated high distinctions about replacing my body. I forgot it at the time. I relaxed at the time. I made high health.
14. The medicine student helped others in their prime become immortal. The woman represented an invitation to the simulation and improving her health. She joined the simulation by time travelling to it. She became immortal. She increased her health by taking care of it.
15. The medicine student didn't need to worry about the build-up of damage to her body. I maintained my health, avoiding risks before body replacement. I avoided unhealthy food. I took care of my body. I performed yoga and qi gong and took herbs regularly.
16. The medicine student increased what he wanted and decreased what he didn't like. I increased my meditation automatically using a computer to help with study in the simulation. I wrote about my meditation experiences, increasing the detail. I helped and worked with people, using this as a topic in my study. I helped others by teaching them meditation.

17. The medicine student always felt calm and took a special moment to do a task. I automatically replaced my body. I did this using a timed algorithm. It asked me if I was ready. I felt relaxed afterwards.
18. The medicine student checked he felt fine after replacing his body. I took time away from time and space travelling to replace my body. I travelled to my destination. I didn't have to do anything. I replaced my body.
19. The medicine student analysed the integration of the body systems. I replaced my body's systems. I replaced my body. This replacement included my body systems. I tested my blood pressure and heart rate.
20. The medicine student benefited from a medical kind of teleportation. I studied my body before and after time travelling and replacing my body. First, I tested my heart rate and blood pressure before the teleports. Second, I performed a kind of teleportation in a way. Third, I tested myself after the teleports.
21. The medicine student kept her youthful appearance. If I meditated, I could time travel. Meditation requires training. In addition, time travel required meditation (writing). I could replace my body using technologies from 5689.
22. The medicine student's writing was about philosophy and computer science, which were difficult to transgress. I could time travel and replace my body in the future. I could see and talk with friends there. I aimed not to transgress technologies from times. I could ask about black boxes.
23. The medicine student travelled to a time to learn to replace their body. First, I learned how to time travel to a time within a short time. Next, I learned how to time travel. Then, sensing the technology was about to expire, I time travelled to a time. Finally, I set up permanent time travel ability and came home.
24. The medicine student remembered to refresh the ways of doing futuristic things: writing 4*50 As or ordering copywriting every ten years. I increased others' knowledge in my own time about how to replace one's body. I saw an old science teacher with dark hair. I saw another old primary school teacher with dark hair. I replaced my body in each time travel destination daily and set my outside appearance to have dark hair.
25. The medicine student worked until she had written 4*50 immortality As and 4*50 medicine As. I set up a reminder document about replacing my body. I ordered copywriting for points from my daily regimen. For instance, I prevented my body systems from ageing in each dimension or time travel destination. I wrote an A on immortality each week.
26. The medicine student kept on going. I helped others to replace their bodies. I explained how to use writing and computers to time travel and indicate immortality. The extra part, the immortality A per week, could be written in 12 sentences per day or fewer than three five-sentence paragraphs. In addition, I recommended they do the same thing about medicine.
27. The medical student aimed to resolve medical questions, including tiredness from studying with copywriting, Berocca, hand-breasoned 5 As and exercise. I could teach people to replace their bodies in schools, gyms, prisons, workplaces, retirement homes and homes. They could choose classes or read about the software privately. I loved time travelling between my house and the future each day. I wrote and programmed.
28. The medicine student wrote visual themes for their music, algorithms and arguments. I replaced my body and inspected the results. I checked the outside of my body. I did mental exercises. I tested my health.
29. The medicine student interpreted and synthesised the work each week. I replaced my body, maintaining my ability to run and live. I could walk each day. I could run regularly. I enjoyed a continuous high quality of life, with breaks and expectedness.
30. The medicine student had 250 breasonings and copywriting to help with their swallowing reflex. I could replace my body to avoid degeneration of my body and exercise. I could lift weights. I could do exercises. I could do diction exercises.
31. The medicine student lived and saw friends and was celibate. I avoided the effects of ageing with body replacement. My inaction didn't cut short my lifespan, and I didn't have to visit a nursing home. I could work and focus on my life forever. People around me were similar, used to immortality, and could visit simulations.
32. The medical student advertised their academy online. The immortal kept the instructions to be immortal permanently online. They taught prerequisite philosophy. The religion was 4*50 As. I grouped these into three for academia and three for industry.

33. The medical student took care of customers. I updated my interests, checking available resources. I created thoughts for customers, predicting them and working out replies. I listened to the customer. I talked with them, answering their questions.
34. The medical student used a specific system to interpret an algorithm to interest students in algorithms. I wrote and used high distinctions. I wrote philosophical thoughts for customers. Once I had written a mind map, I experimented with generated philosophies and chose the best word for each position in the sentence. The sentence could describe an algorithm rhetorically.
35. The medical student tested the latest theory-as-algorithm. I continued with the organisation, treating actions like missions. I wrote algorithmic thoughts. I randomly generated possible algorithm parts, such as methods and simplifications, without giving up features and details. I used an algorithm mock-up, which integrated different algorithm parts in a flow chart.
36. The medical student generated more algorithms than inputs when they had more than a certain number of inputs. I tested the graph for clarity. I drew the exponential graph for the 540-degree algorithm's number of inputs versus outputs, where the 540-degree algorithm found all the a-d's in a-b, c-b and c-d pairs of words. I used the 540-degree algorithm to generate new algorithms, from which I chose more relevant results. I had found the philosophy results were uncannily relevant, so I checked the algorithm results were relevant, on-topic and inspirational. I thought of the philosophical significance of each algorithm for each of the others and wrote new algorithms.
37. The medical student restarted the system to reset a variable's values. I didn't need to repeat myself five times to compensate for the loss of clarity because the text was clear enough. In addition, I generated type statements to connect algorithms with accuracy. Then, I deleted unused variables. These variables included singletons, variables not used for verification or output. I wrote long enough texts for enough detail to earn a high distinction.
38. The medical student chose key details and made app mock-ups with them, for example, finding more useful or original algorithms. I wrote an algorithm that generated tables, screens and text graphics from examples. I wrote an interpreter using this algorithm. In addition, I added details to generated texts to connect their parts. With enough points, the meaning of a text could be uncovered, and it had relevance to other topics.
39. The medical student recorded the type of skills. I captured the debugging and thought data while creating an interpreter. I wrote about the latest writing. For example, I made detailed analyses and found implications and possibilities in philosophy and algorithms. I did this three times to capture the thoughts. The most detailed writing contained a lot of checking and common paths.
40. The medical student augmented their work with art and new possibilities, such as mini-accreditation or mini-business. I found the best new draft of the text. I used DevOps to hand-enter each change, keeping the best current version. On another note, I mind-read myself to see if I wanted a thought accompanying my thought, perhaps because I was tired or was resting. I found the best time, presentation, such as a suggestion about a thought, and content for the thought, not too much and memorable, where it could be read on the computer later. If I didn't want the thought, the computer still checked the thought for errors and helped with the continuation of logic at the best possible time. I also programmed the computer to analyse data as much as necessary in the background for professional requirements or augmentation reasons.
41. The medical student lifted reasons for work from forgotten to memorable by mind-reading experiences and thoughts. The pedagogy accreditation gave me the skills to present myself with up-to-date information, such as a spiritual translucent thinbook. I concentrated on mind reading myself by myself and with others, encouraging others to use the software. Later, I wrote an algorithm writing helper, which suggested and assessed the understanding of algorithms using mind reading. I used a neuronetwork to convert 540-degree output into natural language.
42. The medical student shared business philosophies with business contacts. I helped others to do what I had done in business. I created sales and high-distinction thought commands. I generated breasonings and algorithms, with details for each. I met the professional requirements for these, depending on where I had got up to in education. I created all the thoughts. I made a computer multimedia presentation with all the art related to the project, such as example data for algorithms, which were both simple and user-friendly.
43. The medical student stated that ten breasonings achieved a threshold of the integrity of reasoning. I refreshed the display of recommendations about thoughts. I mind-projected tens (ten breasonings) for incidental representations. These thoughts gave me the courage to think of what I was saying to be thought of, and I found the most relevant connections. The system recommended I keep List Prolog for a more accessible text selection by vision-impaired people and that the Lucian CI/CD algorithm confirm whether to keep comments, including tests and data file changes. I also included an option to ignore Prolog, treating it like an ordinary file and displaying it as Prolog, not List Prolog.
44. The medical student ruled out hallucinated citations. My health was as good as new when I regenerated. I generated enough, or 2*5*50, high distinctions of reasons. The imagery was the reward for a PhD level of awareness. I summarised changes in long documents. I wrote a table of contents of changes on separate pages from other times Lucian CI/CD was run. I wrote two (for the lecturer and student), which could be three (for the customer, manager and employee) *5 (to include prestigious imagery) *50 high distinctions, where 50 As were master's level and 4*50 As were PhD level. The combinations of generati were rapid and relevant using the Grammar Logic or 540-degree (BAG or Breasoning Algorithm Generator) algorithms.
45. The medical student focused on the second stage, the milieu and drama of thoughts. I did upper-body exercises to relax my muscles before body replacement. For most thoughts, I wrote from one to five algorithms. I captured the details from the student's work. I followed lines from a mind map from their perspective to a draft and then the work. The ideas at each point were chosen from many random generations and were assessed on grammar, ingenuity and computational correctness. I also generated details about education skills that explain the work metacognitively or clearly.
46. The medical student identified the best stretches for the race. I mentally and physically prepared each part of my body for the sprint or used DevOps as I went for code cleanliness. I removed phantom, unused loops or variables. I designed an emergency thought pack daily for monarchs, princes and princesses. The correct combination of commands inspired the royals with flower-bearing. I had enough energy to win the race.
47. The medical student thought about their visions. I regenerated my body, renewing my sense of sight. The supplemental thoughts could be used for sales or bots, defined politically on academic issues. I set up a \"do it if I don't do it\" algorithm for needed thoughts in the background. I identified customers' sales in real-time, going back in time to their origin to help them. The supplemental thoughts placed points on sliders to define the viewpoints on academic issues, for example, an agreement that mind reading is like a necessary telephone, making continuity in time travel possible.
48. The medical student suggested immortality as a medical option where possible. The physical state of my eyes was saved when my body was saved to replace my body with immortality. In addition to sales and bots arguments, incidental thoughts were defined politically. The political thoughts involved separating functions and thoughts, choosing the best side and indicating points on a slider about academic issues, such as continuing a previous position or reacting to new data. The worker was laissez-faire, left to their own devices to work, making checking with DevOps and a grammar checker necessary.

49. The medical student checked that the situation was still safe. I wrote the high distinctions from the same perspective. I wrote my thoughts about the law of sanctity. The arguments had certain benefits. The company was protected. The self explained the situation to the other.
50. The medical student checked the place in the image. I ran tests for a predicate with another to determine if they were the same predicate. I found predicates that satisfied the same tests. I tested whether they had the same code. I manually tested whether they were equivalent.
51. The medical student wrote an app that could run offline and online. I regenerated as the lead in my company without reproducing. I ran Prolog from State Saving Interpreter and List Prolog Interpreter for use with web apps. I sped up parts of apps so that they could run online. In addition, some commands could process the pipe (\"|\") character.
52. The medical student later imported buttons and links from the language to State Saving Interpreter (SSI). I regenerated my body and exercised. I made a mock-up Prolog web app engine, for example, for Vetusia, by running Prolog with variables saved. It was faster than SSI. I could edit and convert Prolog, which I could test it in, to the language.
53. The medical student favoured expansionism for later editing. I survived medicine during my years of work. I worked out how to automate Lucian CI/CD. I finished the Prolog converters and made a system that runs and uploads the repository. I ran Lucian CI/CD on my old repositories, with flow-on data as tests, on one predicate at a time.
54. The medical student removed internationalisation in List Prolog for speed. I improved the State Saving Interpreter by writing research on it and testing it in video tutorials. I listed or walked through the program. I explained the program. I simplified it.
55. The medical student bought the latest laptop to focus on business. I wrote philosophy on sections of SSI. I separated work from my mind and simulated generative intelligence (SI). I presented the work I had devised in public. Any other work was attributed to a bot and was cited.
56. The medical student excelled in philosophical breasonings and their dimensions. I used visuals to illustrate SSI. I drew an SSI state machine. In addition, I drew a flowchart of the SSI algorithm. Also, I drafted algorithms possible with SSI with neuronetworks.
57. The medical student made student posts and speed and accuracy competitions in finishing bugs compulsory. I kept my mind fit by completing algorithms and questioning breasonings. I also notified myself before automated changes to programs. Students were expected to think from first principles in exams. I assessed critical thinking, memory, writing and changing (and detecting flaws in) programs.
58. The medical student wrote down and eliminated risks in their life in their journal. I expanded each central algorithm into a master's program and corresponding texts. The students developed a business idea using simulated generative intelligence. Again, As, texts, algorithms, money, and time were no object. The algorithm generated its database.
59. The medical student sounded a notification when the repository had been finished for the moment and was committed. I set finding algorithms such as SSI against the clock. I designed Lucian CI/CD for the web. Users could read about the latest pipelines or complete tests. They could click on the badge in the Read Me to access the corresponding latest versions of related repositories.
60. The medical student included comments in Lucian CI/CD (after acceptance of lines immediately before or after them), notifying the user of this. I completed spiritual yoga. I used switches to relax. I used a button in Lucian CI/CD to automatically accept lines with tests. In addition, I notified the user of possibly unwantedly ignoring data file changes, where no test had tested for them.
61. The medical student turned off automated Lucian CI/CD pipelines so that saving a file wouldn't trigger a pipeline, possibly removing changes or writing a new test. I measured the usual lifespan of each body part and became immortal. In Lucian CI/CD, if no combinations' tests worked, I returned to the previous state of the repositories before any changes. I sounded a failure sound effect and notified the user of likely problems, such as missing or incorrect tests, bugs or missing files.
62. The medical student aimed to maximally expand the code, putting it through a pretty printer. I wrote the epistemology app to find evidence for conclusions. Lucian CI/CD either offered to commit or automatically committed finished files. The woman adhered to the expansionist code policy. Code with different features should be separated unless it is simple and clear to combine them. 
63. The medical student expanded the code into reused modules where necessary. The person looked for evidence that they were immortal, otherwise took action in meditation and pedagogy. The worker worked on many repositories, which was recorded. Lucian CI/CD automatically pretty-printed their work. The others rewarded their work.
64. The medical student identified and stopped failing the code online. I replaced legacy code, noting needing to bring back certain features. I showed the state of the pipeline on the repository's Read Me. It showed whether the current pipeline had passed or failed. Theoretically, it shouldn't indicate that it failed because the pipeline would only upload passing code.

65. The medical student filled in an exercise when they didn't have one. I helped take care of my body with regular exercise. In Lucian CI/CD, I asked for a test when a predicate didn't have one. I found the name and arity of the predicate. I listed whether it had a test and passed it.
66. The medical student reminded the worker to undo the mistake. I projected the image to help the student. I issued the command to undo to the previous stage in Lucian CI/CD. I issued multiple undos. I issued redos.
67. The medical student generated the type statement from the specifications or tests. I chose the opportune time to regenerate. I stated that types were needed not for all new code, but for all code. I wrote the type statement to speed developing accurate code, including [n, name]. I included variable names in the type statement to speed developing code.
68. The medical student repeated the course to test it. I maintained perfect function with exercise. I constantly communicated with the departments of the company. Business organised the website and payments. Education organised the teaching and assessment.
69. The medical student recorded the fortnightly statistics for his software site. I chose the best times to take actions. I recorded the downloads of List Prolog Interpreter. The software was written clearly, with legible documentation. It inspired users to examine Prolog, add modules and play with the code.
70. The medical student gave enough time from when the body had finished one task to do the next. I measured the time my body spent digesting, breathing, remembering, sensing and speaking, and worked out whether these times overlapped, to relax. I separated concatenated texts with a newline. When breasoning out the BAG cache, I made sure the concatenated strings were separated. This ensured that words didn't join together, causing errors when looking them up.
71. The medical student confirmed the location of the problem. I noticed the thoughts found with funnelled detailed mind reading. I ran code related to each test separately. Starting from the bottom, I found the predicates a predicate depended on. I ran tests on these predicates, reporting on bugs found within these predicates, and not testing predicates depending on buggy predicates.
72. The medical student extracted the algorithm from the neuronetwork. When finished, I could work when I wanted to, and replaced the neuronetwork after it had finished. I created a brand with A. It encompassed the aims of the project. It had a jingle and icon.
73. The medical student earned high distinctions during the day. I endorsed the brand with A. The brand had common features with another. I found the unique selling point of the first brand. I gave it A.
74. The medical student modified the seen-as images of the freezing-age BAG algorithm. I gave the customers when they saw the reference to the brand. The mother was at home. The systems seemed professional. I wanted the product.
75. The medical student connected the customer's thoughts, words and actions with the brand. I tried different stretches at different times. In sales, I helped customers to like my brand. In addition, I breasoned out As to do with the brand. I checked whether the customer was epistemologically interested in the brand, i.e. whether they needed, wanted or wanted to research it.
76. The medical student had one seen-as image for each high distinction. I found the best settings for the imagery. The bots had political As. The people found out about the product and thought of whether they needed it more clearly with keyword-As. I funnelled the reason for their need, such as business, personal or education.
77. The medical student found out into the future before the end. I wrote 250 breasonings, supported with 4*50 As, with algorithms. In the diploma academy, I wrote 250 breasonings per assignment. In a higher education institution these were supported with 4*50 As. In a PhD, all the algorithms were complete.
78. The medical student determined whether they were working and funnelled detailed mind reading for As. I exercised my mind, replacing my body to ensure my faculties were still working. Also in education, I breasoned out ten breasonings and 250 algorithm breasonings per day for a student to concentrate in computer science. These algorithm breasonings were specifically designed to help with writing the seen-as version, the A and writing the algorithm. Advanced students mind read their high distinctions using VPSs.
79. The medical student's project found algorithms with algorithms they had written, to answer questions. I timed the high quality thoughts, viable implications of the algorithm. In the academy, students answered multi-choice questions. These were computer science-based. For example, they were the right output of an algorithm, the right input or the right algorithm.
80. The medical student assessed themselves on their writing. I regenerated my writing by reviewing and connecting to it. I wrote an algorithm to write multi-choice questions. I found the paragraph. I detailed-mind-funnelled the key algorithmic sentences. Alternatively, I searched for algorithmic key terms. In the question, I referred to knowledge elsewhere in the essay, or applying this knowledge, using causality or processes.
