First, I waited 70 years until after the secondary text writer, the music producer and text-to-movie software writer died to include their products in my catalogue.  Second, I wrote I, Lucian Green wrote the Breathsonings Essay, it was about my theory of human judgment of objects in a pedagogical sense (i.e. knowledge of it was required to deserve to earn H1), I wrote it in 2013 after taking a break from Science at Monash and discovering my famous essay format, I wrote it in the South Yarra/Toorak Stonnington Library in Melbourne, Australia, I chose the topic from meditation to help answer the question of how to earn H1 at Melbourne University and wrote it after meditating on the pedagogy ways of thinking which I used to write the breasoning chapter which the essay is based on.
