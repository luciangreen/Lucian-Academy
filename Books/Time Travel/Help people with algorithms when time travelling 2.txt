15. I helped the person with the creative algorithm (painting) when time travelling.
16. I helped the king with the algorithm writer (without output other than the first predicate and manually finding and testing every combination) and philosophy writer (help connect key terms with rules with question answering and be able to work the rules for the key terms eventually) when time travelling.
17. I helped use program finder for all levels of the algorithm, with combination algorithm writer for the function in program finder when time travelling.
18. I helped find program finder for reverse-like algorithm (e.g. reprocesses what was processed) when time travelling.
19. I helped find the best of three suggested algorithms (with all base cases and accounted for and one instance of reused elements) with algorithm writer when time travelling.
20. I dotted the program on to make sure that the two universes were identical when time travelling.
21. When time travelling, I helped find the algorithm to find the best day to write algorithms.
22. I helped write the algorithm to 1:1-rebreason out digestion when time travelling.
23. I helped write the algorithm to verify that the two groups of people were treated equitably when time travelling.
24. I helped with simulating the ever-verified-against other when time travelling.
25. I helped display the high quality imagery from time travelling.
