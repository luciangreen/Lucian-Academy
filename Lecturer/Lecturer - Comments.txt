1. I used the comment myself.  I made the comment.  Saying the comment was better than writing it.  I did what I commented to do.  I tested it.
2. I used the formula.  I wrote the formula.  I listed the variables.  I wrote them in places in the formula.  I simplified it.
3. I entered the input.  I wrote the input.  I listed the values.  I found and wrote the value.  I verified it.
4. I realised some more seen-as versions were necessary.  I wrote the output.  I found the output with the algorithm.  I found the seen-as version algorithm.  I formatted the output.
5. I found the people again.  I had the rights to government.  I commented on the model-like.  I commented on the ideal.  It was positive.
6. I programmed the state machine.  I had the rights to state.  I founded the home.  I maintained it.  I led the good life.
7. She had three dependents.  I had the right to vote.  The poor person had a postal address.  She had a bed.  She had a card and support.
8. It was true to the new ends.  I amalgamated the cards.  An amalgam is a mixture.  Reine means pure.  I preferred purity.
9. I tested pedagogy out.  I agreed.  I found each voter.  I encouraged them.  I studied philosophy.
10. With everything programmed in masters, I earned B.  I disagreed.  I interpreted the different language.  I noticed the different language could be mind read.  I coded in the programming language 'L', which took draft features and found the finished code.
