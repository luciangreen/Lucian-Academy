1. I ensured that 3D bodily projection didn't go over ethical boundaries.
2. The projected dance instructor helped the student to perform the step.
3. The projected students helped, not controlled the person.  The projected students enrolled in free University and paid for extras in air dollars.
4. The projected person appeared at a member of the set of acceptable locations to appear, outside.
5. The projected person replicated te utensil when he needed it.
6. The projected person was 100% opaque, had weight and was made of skin and bones.
7. The projected pedagogy helper, who was more developed, compared the person's experience with areas of study before suggesting a breasoning.
8. The projected person's representation looked new when thought of clearly.
9. I trained, not programmed the projected person to eat the apple.
10. I trained the projected person to meditate to produce healthy consciousness.
11. Derrida noted that two things were a sort of thing, pointing to the fact that projected objects had consciousness, meaning that their thoughts needed to be thought of.
12. If everything is made of people projected by something, then they need to be configured to give the best breasoning environment.
13. I ported the completed work to my universe.  I delegated simple tasks to the projected person to avoid work.
14. I tested whether the person was a projection, because they might need help.
