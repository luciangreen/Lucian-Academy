Analysing characteristics of arguments 1 of 4



1. After reading a page on Agn√®s van Rees, the Director of the project Characteristics of Argumentative Discourse found using the Yahoo! search criteria of 'narratology, contention and characteristics', I became interested in resolution of differences of opinion in everyday discussion.

Developmental Conglish, i.e. how if necessary raw evidence needs to be refined and shaped into an argument

Deciding which side of a given debate is right.
