Derivability 0 of 4



1. The first technique can handle two directions between term or sentence and definition. This allows meaning to be worked out from context.

1a. Interpolation

The program can interpolate from definition to sentence (2 to 1), i.e. work out the sentence from a given set of definitions.

1aa. Samantha ate the biscuits (initially unknown)

2a. The biscuits were on the table before Samantha came into the room

b. They weren't there after she left *

c. It was after school, and time for a snack. *

* assumed to be in same section as 2a, i.e. also referring to Samantha eating the biscuits.

In the first technique, order is usually from 1 to 2, but there may be variables that have either any or values from a list.

2. Extrapolation. Finding the definition from a sentence

The program can also extrapolate from sentence to definition (1 to 2), i.e. given similar sentences can work out the definition.

There are three cases so far, and may be more in the future.

a. Synonyms

Given:

1ab. The purse was lost at lunchtime

2. (initially unknown)

a. The purse was left in on a seat.

b. No one returned it.

the program can calculate:

1ac. The wallet was lost at lunchtime

2. (initially unknown)

a. The wallet was left in on a seat.

b. No one returned it.

b. Synogrammars (sentences with the same meaning)

Given:

1ad. We received the books we ordered.

2. (initially unknown)

a. We filled in the order form for the books

b. We sent it in with the money.

the program can calculate:

1ae. The books we ordered arrived.

2. (initially unknown)

a. We filled in the order form for the books

b. We sent it in with the money.

c. Same base word

Given:

1af. We constructed the argument

2. (initially unknown)

a. Constructing is writing.

b. We wrote the argument.

the program can calculate:

1ag. We deconstructed the argument
